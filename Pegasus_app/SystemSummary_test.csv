No.377321 dt.06 08 2021 under Sections 147 148 149 341 323 324 448 379 302 427 354 of the Indian Penal Code 5. The allegation against the petitioners no. 1 and 2 is that they assaulted the mother of the informant with iron rod and stick and also snatched the gold chain and ear ring whereas the petitioner no. 3 is said to have assaulted the sister of the informant with stick and thereafter it is alleged that all the accused including other male members of the family of the petitioner had entered into the house and looted Rs. 27 000 and further against the petitioner no. 4 is that she had also bitten the sister of the informant and all the accused are said to have damaged the motorcycle belonging to the father of the informant by iron rod and stones and had also taken away three mobile phones from the house. It is alleged that the father of the informant was killed due to assault by the accused. 6. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that both the families were agnates and they have been falsely implicated. It was submitted that no reason has been assigned in the FIR for the occurrence whereas accused Santosh Singh of the present case has lodged Muffasil PS Case No. 1121 on the same day for the same occurrence where it is alleged that the informant of the present case along with his brothers had Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.377321 dt.06 08 2021 teased and harassed one of the petitioners and when the family members of the petitioners confronted the informant they were abused and assaulted along with other family members. Learned counsel submitted that the deceased is the own uncle of co accused Santosh Singh Subodh Singh and Randhir Kumar and both the sides are neighbours. Learned counsel submitted that the case is false also for the reason that there is no injury report of the mother of the informant and as far as the sister of the informant is concerned the injury report shows only one lacerated wound above left half upper lip 1” x 1 2” and no sign of bite was found by the doctor. Thus it was submitted that the injury itself appears to be superficial. It was submitted that the entire family including the petitioners who are female members having clean antecedent have been implicated with ulterior motive and as far as the death of the father of the informant is concerned the assault on him is attributed to the other male co accused and not the petitioners. It was submitted that another aspect of the matter is that in the FIR itself it is alleged that when other male members of the petitioners who are also co accused were assaulting the father of the informant the police had arrived and thus if the same is true then there could not have been any further assault on the father of the informant and Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.377321 dt.06 08 2021 the accused would also have been arrested there itself on 22.02.2021 but neither any case was lodged nor arrest made on 22.02.2021 and only after the case was instituted on 23.02.2021 the male members of the petitioners who are accused in the present case were arrested. It was submitted that the informant side had blocked the state highway and indulged in brick batting with the police for which Muffasil PS Case No. 1121 dated 23.02.2021 under Sections 147 148 341 323 504 353 332 of the Indian Penal Code was also instituted in which the informant of the present case and others are accused 7. Learned APP submitted that the petitioners are alleged to have assaulted the mother and bitten the sister of the 8. Learned counsel for the informant submitted that the father of the informant has died due to assault. However it was not controverted that the assault on the father of the informant is attributed to the male co accused in the case and not the petitioners and also that there is no injury report with regard to the mother of the informant as also that only a lacerated wound on the upper lip of the sister of the informant has been found by the doctor as noted in the injury report. 9. Having considered the facts and circumstances of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.377321 dt.06 08 2021 the case and submissions of learned counsel for the parties in the tentative view of the Court the allegations against the petitioners who have been made accused along with their other male members are not corroborated by the material brought before the police inasmuch as there is no injury report with regard to the mother of the informant and further that the sister of the informant has suffered only a lacerated wound above the left half upper lip and the petitioners are ladies without any criminal antecedent the Court is inclined to allow their prayer for grant of pre arrest bail 10. Accordingly in the event of arrest or surrender before the Court below within six weeks from today the petitioners be released on bail upon furnishing bail bonds of Rs 25 000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate Begusarai in Muffasil PS Case No. 1121 subject to the conditions laid down in Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 and furtherthat one of the bailors shall be a close relative of the petitioners that the petitioners and the bailors shall execute bond and give undertaking with regard to good behaviour of the petitioners andthat the petitioners shall cooperate with the Court and Patna High Court CR.

No.194921 dt.25 08 2021 5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that as per the FIR itself the informant has stated that she was made to believe that after 10 days she would be allowed to go upon fulfilling the contract agreement relating to dancing and singing at various functions. He submitted that a few days after that only FIR has been lodged due to dispute relating to money.

Copies of the said documents referred have also been annexed to the supplementary affidavit 9. The allegation against the petitioner is that he had kept the informant and two other girls in his house not allowing them to go out and it is further alleged that they had been hired by the petitioner who runs a dance troupe and that he had also Patna High Court CR.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the allegation is false and the informant and other girls had taken money to perform in his dance troupe and because they neither wanted to perform nor return the money this false case has been instituted. Learned counsel submitted that as per the allegation itself no wrong act was committed and at best only the informant and the girls were being pressurized. It was submitted that the girls because they belong from outside the State were being kept at the house of the petitioner where they were also being properly taken care of with regard to boarding and lodging. Learned counsel further submitted that the medical examination does not disclose any wrong doing and the petitioner is in custody since 04.01.2020 11.

Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for the parties taking into consideration that there is material to indicate that there was a professional relationship between the parties which may have gone sour and most importantly actual physical abuse not being alleged and the allegation being only that the petitioner had tried to commit immoral act but could not succeed the Court is inclined to grant bail to the petitioner 14.

No.10817 2021Allowed subject to all just exceptions and as per extant Rules. The application stands disposed of. W.P.(C) 3576 2021 & C.M. No.10818 2021The present writ petition impugns the order dated 13th October 2020 passed by Central Administrative Tribunalin OA No.2955 2019. By W.P.(C) 3576 2021 the said impugned order OA filed by respondents no.4 to 31 herein was allowed and the seniority list dated 15th March 2018 which was the subject matter of challenge before the CAT was set aside. The present petition has been filed by the petitioners who were the respondents before the CAT. The brief facts giving rise to the present petition are set out The petitioners herein were appointed as Inspectors in the Delhi Commissionerate of the respondents in the year 2016 under the direct recruit quota. The private respondentswere also direct recruits recruited in the year 2011 in various zones outside Delhi. At their request they were transferred to the Delhi Zone in the year 2014. On 31.07.2014 there was a substantial re structuring in the department resulting in steep increase in the number of posts of Inspectors in Delhi Zone. On account of the increase in number of vacancies the private respondents took a transfer to Delhi Commissionerate from their parent cadre and were placed at the bottom of the seniority list. The petitioners who were appointed on direct recruitment basis against the vacancies for the year of 2014 joined cadre only in the year 2016. On 15th March 2018 the respondents came out with a seniority list of Inspectors in which the respondents herein were placed below the petitioners. The seniority list was prepared on the basis of OM No. 20011 1 2012 Estt.(D) dated 4th March 2014 which in turn had been prepared in terms of the ratio of the Hon’ble Supreme court in Union of India & Ors. Vs. N.R. Parmar & W.P.(C) 3576 2021 Ors. 13 SCC 340. The private respondents made various representations against the said seniority list. The representations not having been considered favourably the private respondents filed OA No.1251 2019 challenging the seniority list of Inspectors as on 31st March 2015 issued on 15th March 2018. On 5th August 2019 the official respondents amended the RRs with regard to promotion of Inspectors to the post of Superintendents. On 16th September 2019 the private respondents withdrew OA No.1251 2019 with liberty to file fresh OA. On 30th September 2019 fresh OA No.2955 2019 was filed by the private respondents challenging the seniority list dated 15th March 2018 from which the present petition arises. The main ground of challenge in the said OA was that the petitioners who had joined the department after the joining of the private respondents cannot be placed above them in the seniority list. Reliance was placed on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in K. Meghachandra Singh &Ors. Vs. Ningam Siro & Ors. 5 SCC 689 in which the earlier judgment of N.R. Parmar was overruled. The said OA was contested by both the official respondents as well as the petitioners herein by filing counter affidavits. The said OA 2955 2019 was allowed by the Tribunal vide the impugned order and the seniority list dated 15th March 2018 to the extent it placed petitioners who were appointed and joined Delhi Commissionerate subsequent to the date of the transfer of the private respondents was set aside. It was held by the CAT that the petitioners herein who were appointed in the year 2016 cannot be placed above the private respondents who were appointed in the year 2011 and came on transfer to Delhi Zone in W.P.(C) 3576 2021 the year 2014 the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in N.R. Parmar would apply only in the context of fixation of inter se seniority between the promotees on one hand and direct recruits on the other hand on transfer to Delhi Zone the private respondents would be placed in the seniority after directly recruited Inspectors of the year 2014 on the principle that whoever comes on transfer has to take the last place in the seniority in the zone to which he comes on transfer since the petitioners as well as the private respondents were direct recruits the judgment in N.R. Parmarwould have no impact on them there was no basis or justification to place the petitioners who were appointed in the year 2016 above the private respondents in the Delhi zone andthe judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in N.R. Parmar has been overruled by the Supreme Court judgment in the case of K. Meghachandra Singhpromotees of the vacancies of 2014 were appointed on 1st April 2014 cadre re structuring took place in July 2014 which resulted W.P.(C) 3576 2021 in creation of additional vacancies out of which 459 vacancies were available for direct recruit quota and 229 for promotion quota at that point of time 185 applications for inter Commissionerate transfer were pending from different zones to Delhi Zone it was decided that 200 out of 459 vacancies of direct recruits should be filled up through transfer and remaining 259 vacancies were to be filled up through direct recruitment quota the process for recruitment of 259 Inspectors on direct recruitment basis started on 2nd September 2014 on 7th December 2014 240 more vacancies were made available to be filled through direct recruitment quota and 120 through promotion quota the petitioners qualified the SSC CGL) Examination 2014 against the vacancies for 2014 and were appointed as Inspectors on direct recruitment basis in the Delhi zone in 2016 on 15th March 2018 the respondents finalized the seniority list of Inspectors upto 31st March 2015 in which the name of the private respondents was below the petitioners. 10. The learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the petitioners has strenuously argued that the impugned order of the CAT is erroneous as it fails to consider that while preparing seniority list the recruitment year of the candidates is relevant and not the year in which they join the cadre. The seniority list impugned before CAT was prepared strictly in terms of OM dated 4th March 2014 which was based on N.R. Parmar judgmentRecruitment Year would be the year of initiating the recruitment process against a vacancy year W.P.(C) 3576 2021 Initiation of recruitment process against a vacancy year would be the date of sending of requisition for filling up of vacancies to the recruiting agency in the case of direct recruits in the case of promotees the date on which a proposal UPSC Chairman DPC for convening of DPC to fill up the vacancies through promotion would be the relevant date.” respects in all It was further submitted that on the date the said seniority list was prepared N.R. Parmar judgment of the Supreme Court held the field and therefore the seniority list was correctly prepared on the basis of the said judgment. The said judgment was overruled by a three Judge Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme court in K. Meghachandra Singh judgment supra) which was delivered on 13th November 2019 however the said overruling was prospective and therefore seniority already decided in terms of N.R. Parmarwould be protected. Reliance is also placed on the transfer order dated 20th April 2013 in respect of the private respondents wherein it is specifically noted that transferee officers will be placed below all officers appointed regularly to the post grade in terms of para 3.5 of the DoP&T’s OM dated 3.7.1986. The said Clause 3.5 of the OM dated 3.7.1986 is set out below: “3.5 In cases in which transfers are not strictly in public interest the transferred officers will be placed below all officers appointed regularly to the grade on the date of It was further contended by the Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners that if the directions of the CAT are implemented it would also disturb the inter se seniority between the direct recruits and the promotees. In the impugned seniority list direct recruits and the promotees for the W.P.(C) 3576 2021 vacancies have been interspersed and the promotees have not challenged the same. Therefore in terms of the impugned order of the CAT even the said interspersing between the promotees and the direct recruits would go and the petitioners would become junior to the promotees. 13. The official respondents represented by Mr. Gaurang Kanth Advocate have supported the case of the petitioners. Mr. Kanth has placed reliance on para 3.3 of the OM dated 3.7.1986 and defends the OM dated 4th March 2014 in terms of which the official respondents have correctly drawn the seniority list. 14. Per contra Mr. Harpreet Singh learned counsel for the private respondents submits that the petitioners have wrongly stated that the private respondents are transferees. In reality the said transferees are also direct recruits of the year 2011 and therefore have a right to be interspersed with the promotees of 2015. He further submits that the private respondents were placed at the bottom of the promotees and the direct recruits of 2014. Prior to the cadre re structuring the number of vacancies available for Inspectors in direct recruitment quota was only 12. Only after cadre re structuring in October 2014 the vacancies became 561. So cadre re structuring benefitted petitioners also inasmuch as posts for direct recruits increased. Requisitions to fill in direct recruitment vacancy were sent to SSC only after they had joined Delhi Zone. It was contended that the N.R. Parmar judgment was not applicable because the said judgment dealt with seniority between direct recruits and promotees whereas the controversy in the present case relates to seniority between two different categories of direct recruits inasmuch as the private respondents are also direct recruits W.P.(C) 3576 2021 and this fact has been noted in para 6 of the impugned order. He further submitted that when the private respondents joined the cadre petitioners were not even borne in the cadre. He submits that para 3.3 of the OM dated 3.7.1986 is not relevant as same applies only when an employee is appointed by transfer in accordance with provisions of RRs providing for such transfer in the event of non availability of suitable candidate by direct recruitment or promotion which is not the case here. He further states that the seniority position was not settled when the K. Meghachandra Singh judgment was delivered as the private respondents had filed objections against the seniority list of 15th March 2018 and further had challenged the same before the CAT before the K. Meghachandra Singh judgmentwas delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Therefore it is wrong to state that the seniority position was settled. In rejoinder it has been submitted on behalf of the petitioners thatprivate respondents may be direct recruits but not for the purposes of Delhi Commissionerate promotees and direct recruits sink and sail together and therefore cannot be separated in the seniority list the petitioners who were borne elsewhere have to come after the promotees and the direct recruits and cannot be sandwiched between them the judgment in K. Meghachandra Singhprotected the inter se seniority based on N.R. Parmar(v) when the petitioners applied for transfer there were no posts available under the Delhi Commissionerate and CAT did not examine the aspect of promotees being benefitted at the expense of the W.P.(C) 3576 2021 16. We have examined the rival contentions. It is a matter of fact that the seniority position in the present case was not finally settled when the judgment in the case of K. Meghachandra Singhwas delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on 13th November 2019. The impugned seniority list was issued on 15th March 2018 and immediately thereafter various representations were filed on behalf of the private respondents against the said seniority list. When no response was received on the said representations the private respondents filed the OA before the CAT challenging the said seniority list from which the present petition arises. In fact OA was also filed before the judgment in K. Meghachandra Singh judgmentwas delivered. Therefore it is incorrect on the part of the petitioners to say that the seniority position was settled and therefore the same has to be protected in terms of the judgment in K. Meghachandra Singh judgment had to be applied. The following paragraphs from the judgment in K. Meghachandra Singhmay be referred to: “37. When we carefully read N.R.Parmar it appears to us that the referred OMswere not property construed in the judgment. Contrary to the eventual finding the said two OMs had made it clear that seniority of the direct recruits be declared only from the date of appointment and not from the date of But surprisingly the judgment while referring to the illustration given in the OM in fact overlooks the effect of the said illustration. According to us the illustration extracted in N.R. Parmar itself makes it clear that the vacancies which initiation of recruitment process. W.P.(C) 3576 2021 were intended for direct recruitment in a particular year 1986) which were filled in the next year could be taken into consideration only in the subsequent year’s seniority list but not in the seniority list of 1986. In fact this was indicated in the two OMs dated 7 2 1986 and 3 7 1986 and that is why the Government issued the subsequent OM on 3 3 2008 by way of clarification of the two earlier 38. At this stage we must also emphasise that the Court in N.R. Parmar need not have observed that the selected candidate cannot be blamed for administrative delay and the gap between the initiation of process and appointment. Such observation is fallacious inasmuch as none can be identified as being a selected candidate on the date when the process of recruitment had commenced. On that day a body of persons aspiring to be appointed to the vacancy intended for direct recruits was not in existence. The persons who might respond to an advertisement cannot have any service related rights not to talk of right to have their seniority counted from the date of the advertisement. In other words only on completion of the process the applicant morphs into a selected candidate and therefore unnecessary observation was made in N.R. Parmar to the effect that the selected candidate cannot be blamed for the administrative delay. In the same context we may usefully refer to the ratio in Shankarsan Dash v. Union of India where it was held that even upon empanelment an appointee does not acquire any right. 39. The judgment in N.R. Parmar relating to the Central Government employees cannot in our opinion automatically apply to the Manipur State Police Officers governed by the MPS Rules 1965. We also feel that N.R. Parmar had incorrectly distinguished the long standing seniority determination principles propounded in inter alia Jagdish Ch. Patnaik Suraj Parkash Gupta v. State of J&K and Pawan Pratap Singh v. Reevan Singh. These three judgments and several others with like enunciation W.P.(C) 3576 2021 that under service on the law for determination of seniority makes it jurisprudence abundantly clear seniority cannot be claimed from a date when the incumbent is yet to be borne in the cadre. In our considered opinion the law on the issue is correctly declared in Jagdish Ch. Patnaik and consequently we disapprove the norms on assessment of inter se seniority suggested in N.R. Parmar. Accordingly the decision in N.R. Parmar is overruled. However it is made clear that this decision will not affect the inter se seniority already based on N.R. Parmar and the same is protected. This decision will apply prospectively except where seniority is to be fixed under the relevant rules from the date of vacancy the date of advertisement.” 17. From a reading of the above passages the dicta of the Hon’ble Supreme Court that emerges can be summarized as below: OMs dated 07.02.1986 and 03.07.1986 were not properly construed in the N.R. Parmarjudgment. The said OMs made it clear that seniority of direct recruits had to be fixed from the date of appointment and not from the date of initiation of recruitment process Persons aspiring to be appointed to a vacant post do not have any vested right. Only upon completion of the selection process a candidate becomes a selected candidate and therefore the finding in N.R. Parmarthat the selected candidate cannot be blamed for administrative delay was not correct iii) N.R. Parmar has incorrectly distinguished longstanding seniority determination principles propounded in the following cases: W.P.(C) 3576 2021 a) Jagdish Ch. Patnaik Vs. State of Orissa 4 SCC 456 b) Suraj Prakash Gupta Vs. State of J&K 7 SCC 561 and c) Pawan Pratap Singh Vs. Reevan Singh 3 SCC 267 In service jurisprudence seniority cannot be claimed from the date when the incumbent is yet to be borne in the cadre and therefore norms on assessment of inter se seniority suggested in N.R. Parmar supra) case were disapproved Decision in N.R. Parmar case is overruled however the decision will not affect the inter se seniority already based on N.R. Parmar case and the same is protected. Decision will apply 18. Therefore in our view CAT has correctly applied the dicta in K. Meghachandra Singhcase in the present case and has proceeded to quash the seniority list to the extent it placed the petitioners above the private respondents. The fact that the CAT decision would impact the inter se seniority between the promotees and direct recruits is not the subject matter of the present petition and therefore need not be examined. It is also an admitted position that in the present case requisitions for the appointment of the petitioners were sent to SSC the recruiting authority on 11th February 2015 after the private respondents had already joined the Delhi Commissionerate. Therefore even in terms of OM dated 4th March 2014 the petitioners cannot be placed above the private respondents. W.P.(C) 3576 2021 APRIL 09 2021 19.

Salgare the learnedAdditional Public Prosecutor for respondentno.1 State. 4.The allegations averments made inthe FIR in short are that deceased RatanPandurang Uchit was elder brother of firstinformant Shankar Pandurang Uchit. He wasagriculturist by profession. His first wifewas a Cancer patient. She had committedsuicide getting depressed with Cancer ofwhich she was suffering. Deceased Ratan hastwo children born from the first wife. Afterthe death of first wife Ratan performedsecond marriage with applicant on 11.09.2018 as per Hindu rites and customs prevailing in on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt3their community at Mayur Park area ofAurangabad. The first husband of theapplicant had died prior to her marriage withdeceased Ratan Uchit. After marriage theapplicant used to pick up quarrel withdeceased Ratan Uchit frequently on pettyreasons. Ratan Uchit used to inform about thesame to his younger brother i.e. firstinformant Shankar Uchit. On 07.02.2019 atabout 8.30 a.m. when Shankar Uchit firstinformant had been to his field situatedwithin the limits of village Makranpur so asto bring milk at that time his cousinbrother Pandit Uchit informed him that RatanUchit has committed suicide by hanginghimself to the Neem Tree standing on thedyke of their field. Upon knowing the same Shankar Uchit rushed to the aforesaid spotand saw his brother Ratan Uchit hanging tothe tree. In pursuance of the informationreceived the Police reached there removedthe dead body of Ratan Uchit from the NeemTree to which he was hanging and preparedthe inquest panchanama. During the course ofdrawing inquest panchanama along with a CellPhone one suicide note was found in thepocket of pant worn by deceased Ratan. Fromthe contents of that suicide note Shankar on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt4Uchit first informant has realized that hisbrother Ratan Uchit has committed suicide bygetting fed up with quarrels raised by theapplicant constantly. After performingfuneral and last rituals on the dead body ofRatan Uchit one more suicide note leftbehind by him was found kept near a SpeedMeter of motorcycle bearing no.MH 20 DL 1726.The recitals of the said suicide note wereidentical with the earlier suicide note foundin the pocket of pant of Ratan Uchit.According to Shankar Uchit first informant his brother Ratan Uchit has committed suicideby getting fed up with the quarrels beingraised by the applicant frequently for pettyreasons. Therefore the applicant isresponsible for the suicide death of hisbrother Ratan Uchit. 5.Mr.Suvidh Kulkarni the learnedAdvocate while taking us through the FIR annexed to the application vehemently arguedthat only after four months and six days ofmarriage with applicant Ratan Uchit hascommitted suicide. FIR sought to be quashedhas been registered for the offence ofabetment to commit suicide punishable undersection 306 of the I.P.C. The allegations on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt5about abetment made in the FIR are very muchvague in nature. Details of alleged quarrelsdo not find place in the FIR In order tobring home guilt under section 306 of theI.P.C. it is necessary to prove theabetment. Section 107 of the I.P.C. defines`Abetment’. On the basis of the allegationsmade in FIR it cannot be gathered thateither the applicant instigated orintentionally aided deceased Ratan Uchit forcommission of suicide. Allegations made inFIR that the applicant used to pick up pettyquarrels with deceased Ratan Uchitfrequently in any case do not satisfy thedefinition of abetment. When there are noallegations made in the FIR from which it canbe gathered that the applicant intentionallyinstigated her husband Ratan Uchit to commitsuicide and in pursuance of the saidinstigation Ratan Uchit her husbandcommitted suicide there is no propriety indragging the applicant to face the trial which would ultimately result into hisacquittal. 6.In support of his submissions Mr.Kulkarni learned Advocate has placedreliance on the judgment of Coordinate Bench on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt6of this Court delivered in the case of Dilipand Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors.{2016 All MR4328}.7.Per contra Mr.Yogesh Bolkar thelearned Advocate strenuously argued thatRatan Uchit had committed suicide only afterfour months and six days of the marriageperformed with the applicant. The applicantis a quarrelsome woman. In a short span offour months and few days of the marriage shehad harassed her husband Ratan Uchitmentally to a great extent by picking upquarrels with him frequently for pettyreasons. The applicant has not seriouslydisputed genuineness of suicide notes leftbehind by Ratan Uchit. Both the suicide notesare identical. The suicide notes and recitalsof the FIR lodged by the real younger brotherof Ratan Uchit show that harassment by theapplicant was to such an extent that deceasedRatan Uchit was left with no otheralternative but to end his life. Nothing onrecord indicating that Ratan Uchit wassuffering from mental disease. The applicantalso does not say so. Ratan Uchit wasmentally and physically fit would not havecommitted suicide unless harassment on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt7ill treatment meted out by the deceased wasof such a gravity which led him to commitsuicide. According to Mr.Yogesh Bolkar learned Advocate the recitals of FIR are prima facie quite sufficient to make out thecase under section 306 of the I.P.C. againstthe applicant. Therefore the application forquashing FIR is liable to be dismissed. 8.Mr.S.J. Salgare the learnedAdditional Public Prosecutor for respondentno.1 State submitted that having regard tothe allegations made in the FIR and recitalsof both the suicide notes left behind byRatan Uchit it cannot be said that the FIRis wholly imaginary. According to Mr.Salgare the investigation is almost completed andthus accordingly prayed for dismissal ofapplication. 9.Practically in all matters underSection 482 of the Code of Criminalprocedure 1973 the accused approaches theCourt on the ground that the FirstInformation Reporton the face of it does not disclose ingredients that wouldconstitute a cognizable offence. Thus theinherent power of the High Court in it’s on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt8jurisdiction under Section 482 is invokedfor seeking the quashing of the FIR. 10.In C.B.I. Vs. Tapan Kumar Singh6 SCC 175 : AIR 2003 SC 4140 theHonourable supreme court has held inparagraph 22 that “The law does not requirethe mentioning of all the ingredients of theoffence in the FIR. It is only aftercompletion of the investigation that it maybe possible to say whether any offence ismade out on the basis of the evidencecollected by the investigating agency.” It isobserved that an FIR is not an encyclopediawhich must disclose all the facts and detailsrelating to the offence alleged to have beencommitted. It requires no debate that an FIRis merely a report by the informant about thecommission of a cognizable offence and itcannot be ruled out that minute details maynot be mentioned. It cannot be ignored thatan FIR pertains to an offence which isalleged to have been committed and theinformant in a disturbed state of mind andshaken on account of a serious offencecommitted approaches a police station forrecording an FIR. on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt911.In the State of Punjab Vs. DharamSingh 621 : 1987 Supp. SCC89 the Honourable Supreme Court held thatthe High Court had erred in quashing the FIRby going beyond the averments to consdierthe merits of the case even before theinvestigating agency has embarked upon thelegal exercise of collecting evidence.12.In Kurukshetra University Vs. Stateof Haryana4 SCC 451 : AIR 1977 SCC2229( a Three Judges bench) the HonourableSupreme Court has observed thus: “It surprises in the extremethat the High Court thought thatin the exercise of its inherentpowers under Section 482 CriminalProcedure Code it could quash andFIR. The Police had not evencommenced investigation into thecomplaint filed by the warden ofthe University and no proceedingat all was pending in any Court inpursuance of the FIR. It ought tobe realized that inherent powersdo not confer any arbitraryjurisdiction on the High Court toact according to its whim orcaprice.” 13.In Geeta Mehrotra and another Vs. on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt10State of uttar Pradesh and another 10SCC 741 the Honourable Supreme Court hasheld that in the absence of any specificallegation and an FIR prima facie indicating no case against the co accused the Court would have the power to quash anFIR.14.In Parbatbhai Aahir alias ParbatbhaiBhimsinhbhai Karmur and others vs. State ofGujarat and another 9 SCC 641 theHonourable supreme Court has laid down theguiding principles to be considered indetermining whether an FIR could be quashed as under: “(1) Section 482 CrPC preserves theinherent powers of the High Courtto prevent an abuse of the processof any court or to secure the endsof justice. The provision does notconfer new powers. It onlyrecognises and preserves powerswhich inhere in the High Court.The invocation of thejurisdiction of the High Court toquash a first information report ora criminal proceeding on the groundthat a settlement has been arrivedat between the offender and thevictim is not the same as theinvocation of jursidiction for thepurpose of compounding an offence. on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt11While compounding an offence thepower of the court is governed bythe provisions of Section 320 CrPC.The power to quash under Section482 is attracted even if theoffence is non compoundable.In forming an opinionwhether a criminal proceeding orcomplaint should be quashed inexercise of its jurisdiction underSection 482 the High Court mustevaluate whether the ends ofjustice would justify the exerciseof the inherent power.While the inherent power ofthe High Court has a wide ambit andplenitude it has to be exercised(i) to secure the ends of justice orto prevent an abuse of theprocess of any court.In the exercise of thepower under Section 482 and whiledealing with a plea that thedispute has been settled the HighCourt must have due regard to thenature and gravity of the offence.Heinous and serious offencesinvolving mental depravity oroffences such as murder rape and on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt12dacoity cannot appropriately bequashed though the victim or thefamily of the victim have settledthe dispute. Such offences are truly speaking not private innature but have a serious impactupon society. The decision tocontinue with the trial in suchcases is founded on the overridingelement of public interest inpunishing persons for seriousoffences.In such a case the HighCourt may quash the criminalproceeding if in view of thecompromise between the disputants the possibility of a conviction isremote and the continuation of acriminal proceeding would causeoppression and prejudice andThere is yet an exceptionto the principle set out in on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt13Propositionsandabove Economic offences involving thefinancial and economic well being ofthe State have implications whichlie beyond the domain of a meredispute between private disputants.The High Court would be justified indeclining to quash where theoffender is involved in an activityakin to a financial or economicfraud or misdemeanour. Theconsequences of the act complainedof upon the financial or economicsystem will weigh in the balance.” 15.In the light of the aforesaidsubmissions made by the learned Advocates ofboth the sides and the crystalised positionof law for invocation of powers under section482 of the Cr.P.C. we have carefully gonethrough the FIR. It is pertinent to note thatthe marriage between Ratan Uchit and theapplicant was the second marriage for both ofthem. It is evident from the record thatRatan Uchit has died due to hanging on thetree only after four months and six days ofthe marriage with the applicant. Theapplicant has not seriously disputed thenature of death of her husband Ratan. Thedispute is only about abetment. It is settledposition of law that intention is theconcomitant of the abetment. Merely for the on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt14reason that details of quarrels alleged tohave been raised by the applicant with herhusband Ratan Uchit have not been given inthe FIR an inference cannot be drawn thatthe alleged quarrels had no nexus with thesuicide death of Ratan Uchit. The allegationsabout quarrels being picked up by theapplicant with deceased Ratan Uchitfrequently are supported by two suicidenotes left behind by deceased Ratan Uchit.There is nothing on record showing that RatanUchit was suffering from any mental diseaseor chronic ailment. When Ratan was mentallyand physically fit he had no reason tocommit suicide unless harassment meted outby the applicant was of such nature andextent which would compel him to commitsuicide. 16.In Dilip and otherstheCoordinate Bench of this Court afterconsidering the various judgments of theHon’ble Supreme Court has held as under : “unless there is clear mens rea tocommit an offence or active act ordirect act which led the deceased tocommit suicide seeing no option or the on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt15act intending to push the deceased intosuch a position the trial against theaccused under Section 306 of the IndianPenal Code in our considered view would be an abuse of process of law.”17.In Dilip and othersaJudicial Officer had committed suicide on histransfer to Taluka place from the districthead quarters by his superior JudicialOfficer. Except the grievance of transfer the deceased Judicial officer had no othergrievance against his superior JudicialOfficer. In suicide note Junior JudicialOfficer who committed suicide has expressedanguish against the Senior Judicial Officer.Having regard to all these facts theCoordinate Bench of this Court had quashedthe FIR. 18.The facts of the case at hand arealtogether different. Ratan Uchit wasmentally and physically fit person hascommitted suicide only within four months andsix days after the marriage with theapplicant and it is alleged in the FIR andtwo suicide notes left behind by deceasedRatan Uchit that the applicant used to pick on 06 04 2021 on 07 04 1606.19APPLN.odt16up quarrels with him frequently. Therefore he was fed up and committed suicide. In viewof these material allegations made in the FIRand two suicide notes left behind by deceasedRatan Uchit at this juncture inferencecannot be drawn that the applicant did notinstigate her husband Ratan Uchit to commitsuicide or there was no intention behind thequarrels which she used to pick up with herhusband frequently. Only after trial thismaterial aspect can be decided. Therefore itis not proper to quash the FIR gettinginfluenced with the submission that theapplicant had no intention to drive herhusband Ratan Uchit to commit suicide. 19.In view of above we are notinclined to quash the FIR. Accordingly theapplication is rejected.(RAVINDRA V. GHUGE J.)SGA ,"(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 19, 2021.

HARI SHANKAR JUDGMENT28.06.2021 Video Conferencing) This petition has been taken up on mention as listing was allowed in view of the urgency involved. With consent of parties the petition is being disposed of in view of the nature of the controversy. It is not necessary to dwell in detail on the facts. Suffice it to state that Suit No. 82888 2016 had been preferred by the petitioner before the learned Senior Civil Judge Saket challenging the proposal of the DDA to demolish the property of the petitioner located at D 66 3 Gautam Nagar New Delhi. Said suit was dismissed by the learned Senior Civil Judge vide order dated 8th April 2021 under Order XVII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908. W.P.(C) 6033 2021 Court. The petitioner moved an application for restoration of the suit. However Mr. Dalal submits that as the presiding officer of the court which was dealing with the petitioner’s suit is not sitting the application for restoration has not been listed. Given the present scenario in which the trial courts are functioning only on a virtual and restricted mode he submits that despite his client’s best efforts it has not been possible to have the restoration application listed before the In the meanwhile he submits that his client has been constrained to move the present petition before this Court as the respondents are taking action to demolish the aforesaid property. As such the petition seeks a restraint on the respondents demolishing the property till final decision in SCJ 82888 2016. Mr. Dalal states fairly that though stricto sensu SCJ 82888 2016 does not survive he seeks status quo regarding the aforesaid property till the decision on the restoration application filed by his client. 5. Mr. Dhanesh Relan learned Standing Counsel for the DDA submits that the property of the petitioner has already been demolished though the said assertion is disputed by Mr. Sunil Dalal on instructions. In my opinion the petitioner cannot be subjected to prejudice merely because of difficulty in having his application for restoration listed before the court given the present strained circumstances. W.P.(C) 6033 2021 7. As such without entering into the disputes between the parties on merits I am inclined to dispose of this petition in the following The learned District JudgeSaket is requested to assign a suitable court to consider the application filed by the petitioner for restoration of SCJ 82888 2016 and have the matter listed before the said court on 7th July 2021. Needless to say learned Counsel for the parties would be intimated the details of the court before which the matter is to be listed by e mail at their respective e mail IDs. The matter would be taken up by video conferencing on the said date. ii) The DDA shall maintain status quo as of now as it exists at 05:30 p.m. on 28th June 2021 till and subject to the decision of the appropriate court on the petitioner’s application for iii) The learned trial court shall decide the petitioner’s application for restoration on its own merits uninfluenced by any observations contained in this order. It is reiterated that this Court has not returned any observations on merits on the disputes between the parties. The petition stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 000554 0005521 SUMAN DEVI & ORS ….APPELLANTcomplain that the Uttarakhand High Court’s ruling1 regarding their ineligibility for 1By judgment dated 7th July 2017 in Special Appeal No. 156 143 150 2017 and other connected appeals and writ appointment to the cadre of Family Health WorkerAuxiliary Nurse Midwivesand Health Supervisoris erroneous. The Government of Uttarakhand had advertised on 15.03.2016 440 vacancies of FHW Female) and ANM relative to several years’ backlog. The advertisements were challenged as being contrary to the recruitment rules the challenge was upheld by a single judgeand whose decision was affirmed by the The erstwhile United Provinces enacted a law brought into force w.e.f 25.08.1934was brought into force. Its objective was to set up a Central Councilto establish a uniform standard of training for nurses midwives and health visitors. Section 16 of the INC Act enables the council to prescribe curricula for training and conditions for admission Section 10 of the Act enacted that qualifications included in Part I of the Schedule shall be recognized qualifications and the qualifications included in Part II of the Schedule shall be recognized higher qualifications. The text of the provision is extracted in the footnote below.3 Section 11 stated that notwithstanding other laws any recognized qualification 2 United Provinces Nurses Midwives Assistant MidwivesRegistration Act 1934 3 “10.

By Section 11(1 b) any individual not possessing the recognized qualifications could not be enrolled in any State register as a nurse midwife auxiliary nurse midwife health supervisor etc However an exception was made through the proviso for the continuation of those who had been registered prior to the coming into force of the enactment. Section 15 A of the INC Act provides for the establishment of an Indian Nurses Register to be maintained by the council. Section 16 which is important for the purpose of this judgment enables the council to frame regulations the relevant part is extracted in the footnote below.4 The composite State of Uttar Pradesh framed the Uttar Pradesh Department of Medical Health and Family Welfare Health Worker and Health SupervisorService Rules 1997 under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. Rule 5(1) of the 1997 Rules prescribed that direct recruitment through the Public Service Commission of Health Worker would be from amongst such male candidates who successfully nurses midwives or health visitors for the settling of a scheme of reciprocity for the recognition of qualifications and in pursuance of any such scheme the Council may declare that a qualification granted by any authority in any such territory or country or such qualification only when granted after a specified date shall be a recognised qualification for the purposes of this Act Provided that no declaration shall be made under this sub section in respect of any qualification unless by the law and practice of the foreign country in which the qualification is granted persons domiciled or originating in India and holding qualifications recognised under this Act are permitted to enter and practice the nursing profession in that country Provided further thatany reciprocal arrangements subsisting at the date of the commencement of this Act between a State Council and any authority outside India for the recognition of qualifications shall unless the Council decides otherwise continue in force and ii) any qualification granted by an authority in a territory of India to which this Act did not extend at the date of its commencement and recognised on the said date by the State Council of a State to which this Act then extended shall continue to be a recognised qualification for the purpose of registration in that State 4) The provisions of sub sectionsandand of sections 14 and 15 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the declaration by the Council of a qualification granted in respect of post certificate nursing training as a recognised higher 4“16. Power to make regulations.The Council may make regulations not inconsistent with this Act generally to carry out the provisions of this Act and in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing powers such regulations may provide for g) prescribing the standard curricula for the training of nurses midwives and health visitors for training courses for teachers of nurses midwives and health visitors and for training in nursing administration h) prescribing the conditions for admission to courses of training as aforesaid i) prescribing the standards of examination and other requirements to be satisfied to secure for qualifications recognition under this Act.” complete the one year basic health worker training course conducted by the departmental divisional training centers of the state. Likewise Rule 5(2) prescribed for direct recruitment through the Public Service Commission from amongst such female candidates who had successfully completed one year and a half year basic mahila health worker training courseconducted by the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council Lucknow. Such candidates also had to be duly registered under the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council Lucknow Rule 8 which is relevant for the purpose of deciding this batch of appeals reads as “Rule 8. Academic qualification A candidate for Direct Recruitment to the post of Health Workermust have successfully completed prescribed training course for Basic Health Workerof the State of Uttar Pradesh ii) A candidate for Direct Recruitment to the post of Health Worker Female) must have successfully completed prescribed training course for Basic Health Worker conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council Lucknow and is also duly registered in the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council Lucknow Provided that after enforcement of Uttar Pradesh Medical Health and Family Welfare Department Health Workers and Health Supervisors Male & Female) Servicerules 1998 it is necessary that for selection for such training the candidate must pass the Intermediate Examination with Science subject of Secondary Education Board U.P. or any examination equivalent thereto.” The 1997 Rules were apparently amended in 1998. Rule 14 which was substituted by this amendment reads as follows “Rule 14After enforcement of Uttar Pradesh Medical Health and Family Welfare Department Health Workers and Health Supervisors Male & Female) Servicerules 1998 the process of selection of candidates for training as prescribed under Rule 8 as amended from time to timeGroup ‘C’ shall be made under the provisions provided under Direct Recruitment Rules 1998. The number of candidates selected for training would be as per number of Sub Rule at the time of making selection under Sub Section the provisions of reservation shall be followed as prescribed in Rule 6.” In the aforesaid rules in place of existing Rule 15 mentioned below in Columnshall be replaced with the rule mentioned in Column 2.” The State of Uttarakhand was formed pursuant to the re organization of the State of U.P the new state came into existence on 09.11.2000. The laws in force in the erstwhile composite U.P. State were adopted and continued to remain in force in Uttarakhand. Thus the 1997 Rules providing for recruitment of Health Workertogether with the 1998 amendments continued to remain in force in Uttarakhand. In the meanwhile on 02.01.2007 by a notification published in the Central Government Gazette the regulations published by the council under Section 16 of the INC Act were brought into force they stated that the basic educational qualification in order to be enrolled for the Nursing Auxiliary Programme was the Secondary School Certificate Examination. The relevant extract of the said notification is reproduced below “Secondary School Certificate Examination 10th class or central board secondary education or a recognized equivalent public examination. Subjects of study must be equivalents to those prescribed by the CBSE for the Class X with minimum 45%.” The INC again amended the regulations on 21.10.2016. These amendments were made applicable with effect from July 2012. The course was made into a two year course. The minimum qualification provided for joining the course was to be 12 years of schooling. The relevant extract of the said amended criteria is as follows “The minimum educational requirement shall be the passing of 12 years of schooling recognised by CBSE ICSE SSSCE HSCE or a recognised equivalent examination.” It is in this background that on 15.03.2016 an advertisement was issued by the Uttarakhand Government inviting applications for appointment of trained ANMs in terms of the prevailing rules. However the appointment did not spell out that the candidates ought to have finished their schooling with science as a subject. The relevant eligibility criteria in the said advertisement read as follows Candidate must have acquired educational qualifications prescribed by Indian Nursing Council New Delhi Candidate must be registered with Uttarakhand Nurses and Midwives Council Dehradun Photocopies of the statement of marks and the certificates shall be Soon after the advertisement was issued the Uttarakhand Medical Health and Family Welfare Health Worker and Health SupervisorService Rules 2016were brought into force. These were statutory in nature and replaced the 1997 Rules. The Rules significantly amended the eligibility criteria in a graded manner for different years. Rule 8(2) which is relevant for the purpose of the present discussion reads as follows 8(2) Health WorkerA candidate must pass intermediate education of Uttarakhand Board and successfully completed two year course of Basic Health Workertrainingor equivalent recognised qualification by the State Government ii) But for the selection year 2010 to 2013 those applicants who has passed 10th class examination from Board of High School and successfully completed 18 months course of Basic Health Worker Female) training or equivalent recognized qualification by the State Government iii) The Candidate has passed Intermediate Examination of the Uttarakhand Board or any other equivalent qualification in addition to which the candidates must have successfully completed 18 months course of Basic Health Worker Female) training or equivalent recognized qualification prior to the selection year 2010 iv) The candidate must be duly registered in the Nurses and Midwifery Council of Uttarakhand.” 11. Writ petitions were preferred before the Uttarakhand High Court questioning the advertisement and seeking a direction that the recruitment to the extent it was contrary to the rulesbe set aside. A learned single judge of the High Court after issuing notice to the state and hearing the parties allowed those writ petitions. The present appellants approached the Division Bench aggrieved by that decision contending that the advertisement was correctly framed because the INC’s regulations did not require science as an essential subject in the qualifying 10 th standard or 12th standard examination and that they had been registered in terms of the INC’s regulations. They contended therefore that the single judge erred in holding that they were ineligible Contentions of parties It is contended by Ms. V. Mohana learned senior counsel for the appellants that they had qualified in the Intermediate level at the relevant times in Arts. These appellants also underwent the same syllabus and training as the candidates who had passed Intermediate in Science. She urged that rather than requiring that those qualified for admission to the ANM Course should have qualified Intermediate in Science the State should have adopted a rational principle such as inter se merit among the candidates in the completion of the concerned courses. It was urged that that there is no intelligible differentia distinguishing students with Intermediate in Arts and those who have done Intermediate in Science nor is there any rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The insistence of the science subject amongst two persons falling in the same class i.e. those who had completed Intermediate and were registered with the INC was discriminatory It was argued that the purpose of every service rule is to provide equal opportunity to all. It is submitted that the result of the statutory rule contained in the proviso limiting the persons qualified to undergo the ANM course to those who have done Intermediate in Science is to offend the right to equality. The result of the rule is that it does not permit a person to work in the State of Uttarakhand as a Health Worker for the mere reason that the person has done Intermediate in Arts. The appellants also submit that there is a legitimate expectation that having completed the course of ANM they would be considered for employment in Uttarakhand given that they were It was further argued that having regard to the provisions of the 1947 Act which is a central enactment traceable to Entry 66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule for the purpose of attaining uniformity in standards of education when the Centre has prescribed a uniform norm for getting admitted to the ANM Course the states cannot prescribe a different criteria for recruitment to their posts or cadres and exclude the appellants who conform to the requirements under the 1947 Act. It was pointed out that regulations were framed under Section 16 of the 1947 Act and that the prescription confining eligibility to those who have completed Intermediate in Science was It was argued that there was no whisper in the impugned advertisement that the 1997 Rules would apply. Counsel relied on Articles 15(2) and 16(2) in regard to the advertisement pursuant to which the petitioners5 appliedand 16(2). It was next argued that even though the rule contemplates training imparted by the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council there was actually no training imparted by the UP Nurses and Midwives Council that training was by some other body. The rule was therefore rendered unworkable. 17. Relying upon the judgment in Desh Bandhu Gupta v. Delhi Stock Exchange6 it was argued that the conditions spelt out in the advertisement as the eligibility norms for purposes of recruitment had to be given effect to. Further relying upon the subsequent decision of this Court in N.P.N. Devin Katti v. Karnataka Public Service Commission7 learned senior counsel urged that the criteria and conditions spelt out in the advertisement would continue to bind the State till the end of the selection or the recruitment as the case may be and any intervening and subsequent change in the rule position would not affect the ongoing recruitment process. It was subsequently urged therefore that since the advertisement was issued on 15.03.2016 the subsequent amendment which came into force on 26.07.2016 could not be made applicable. In short it was urged that the State was bound by the standards it prescribed in this case the conditions spelt out in the advertisement never stated that to be considered eligible 5Who were petitioners in Writ PetitionNo. 6416. 6(1979) 4 SCC 565 73 SCC 157 a qualified and registered ANM should have completed or graduated with intermediate 10+2 examination in the Science stream 18. Other counsel appearing for the appellants urged that some of the appellants had undergone the ANM Course in training institutes in the State of Uttarakhand and others had obtained ANM certificates from different states. It was submitted that the training institutes invited applications and though the appellants had completed Intermediate in Arts they were enrolled on the ANM course which they successfully completed as they did with the training programme. In these circumstances the state could not discriminate against them. It was argued that after having imparted training these appellants could not be denied appointment. 19. Counsel further submitted that the adoption order issued under Section 87 of the U.P. Reorganisation Act 2000 did not expressly refer to the amendment by which the proviso was inserted on 10.09.1998. It was argued that the advertisement prescribed that candidates should possess the qualifications prescribed by the INC which the appellants did. Consequently there could have been no valid basis to reject their candidature It was lastly urged that given that all the appellants had qualified previously and were waiting for selection and furthermore that many persons on the rolls of the government and working as ANMs had not qualified in Science it would be unfair and discriminatory to exclude the appellants and not consider their candidature The learned AAG who argued on behalf of the State submitted that undoubtedly the advertisement was issued on 15.03.2016. He however emphasized the fact that the 1997 Rules as amended in 1998held the field. Repelling the arguments on behalf of the appellants that the U.P. Reorganization Act did not specifically adopt the Rules he urged that there was nothing to the contrary in Section 87 of the Reorganization Act or any adopted order. It was submitted that the Uttarakhand Government had not made any regular selection from inception. Given the position in the recruitment rules registered ANMs who had qualified in their intermediate examinations or school boards in the science stream were alone eligible for consideration. He submitted further that there is no automatic appointment merely on the strength of having qualified in the ANM examination and having undergone the training or for that matter having been registered and that the concerned selection committee constituted under the Rules was under a duty to consider applications on the basis of batch wise seniority and those eligible “in accordance with the Rules” could be recommended for appointment. He relied upon Rule 15 in this regard Learned counsel for the State submitted that for the purposes of recruitment to civil posts or services within the State the state has the competence to prescribe eligibility conditions. The question of the rules in the present case conflicting with the standards prescribed under the 1947 Act cannot arise. It was submitted in this regard that the said enactment sets up the Nursing Council which under Section 16 prescribes the regulations standards which institutions must fulfill in order for their courses to be recognized. However whether the holding of such qualifications per se binds the State to accept them or prescribe additional qualifications or experience for employment within the State is exclusively that of the State’s domain. In exercise of this power the State is competent to prescribe recruitment rules as it did as the erstwhile State of U.P did in 1997 when Rule 8 along with other rules were brought into force and subsequently amended in 1998. That rule specifically stated that apart from completing the ANM course to be eligible for appointment as an ANM in the Uttarakhand Government or its institutions the concerned candidate also should have qualified in the Science Stream at the 10+2 or equivalent level of education. It was submitted that this condition is reasonable and cannot by any stretch of imagination be deemed to be repugnant to the provisions of the 1947 Act. The 1947 Act only applies to standards prescribed by the Nursing Council. That council does not have the competence to prescribe the conditions for employment in any given State It was argued that the applicability or otherwise of the 2016 Rules was neither pleaded nor urged before the High Court. Learned counsel emphasized that a close reading of the said Rules especially Rule 8 would show that prior to 2010 the rule position was that to be considered for appointment as ANM the candidate should have qualified in the concerned course and also graduated with Science in the school board intermediate. For the brief period between 2010 and 2013 the insistence on qualifying in the science stream was relieved and instead of the 10+2 or intermediate qualification candidates who had passed the 10th standard with requisite ANM completion certification and training were deemed eligible. In other words for the three year period up to 2013 a candidate was not required to have qualified in the 12th standard in the science stream. For the period 2013 2016 candidates could apply only if they had an intermediate or equivalent qualification with science subjects together with ANM qualification and training. Only with the advent of the 2016 Ruleswere those with Intermediate qualification not necessarily with science but also qualifying in a recognized ANM course with requisite training deemed eligible. It was argued that since none of the petitioners fell in the category of those qualified between 2010 2013 but rather had completed their Intermediate and the relevant ANM course with training prior to 2010 or after 2013 the question of their being eligible did not arise It was argued that the State could not be faulted nor bound down by the omission to advert to the relevant eligibility criteria in the advertisement. In this regard it was submitted that the advertisement itself spelt out that the concerned recruitment would be in accordance with the prevailing rules8 8The concerned condition in the advertisement reads as follows “7. Selection: Selection on above posts shall be done under provisions of relevant Departmental Service It was submitted that the new rules did not indicate that they were retrospective and consequently could not have applied to the appellants or the ongoing recruitment in which case only could the appellants or some of them be deemed eligible. It was submitted that the entire claim of the appellants were the eligibility conditions specified in para 3 of the advertisement. Lastly it was urged that neither were the rules nor was the advertisement challenged and in these circumstances the question of any condition being discriminatory did not arise Analysis and Conclusions From the above factual narration it is evident that in the present case before the formation of the state of Uttarakhand rules which governed recruitment and other conditions of service in relation to health workers and ANMs had been framed by the erstwhile state of Uttar Pradesh. Those rules were amended in 1998 the result of the amendment to the existing rules was that minimum qualifications of intermediate or equivalent in the science stream were essential for recruitment and appointment to the cadre of Female Health Workers and ANMs. Every candidate of course should have completed the ANM course with the mandatory training nevertheless the educational qualification of having completed intermediate in science was essential. This court finds no merit in the submission of the appellants that the requirement of an intermediate in science stream did not exist since the adaptation order under the Reorganization Act omitted to mention the rules framed by the erstwhile state of UP. Sections 87 and 88 of the Reorganization Act read as follows “87. Power to adapt laws.—For the purpose of facilitating the application in relation to the State of Uttar Pradesh or Uttaranchal of any law made before the appointed day the appropriate Government may before the expiration of two years from that day by order make such adaptations and modifications of the law whether by way of repeal or amendment as may be necessary or expedient and thereupon every such law shall have effect subject to the adaptations and modifications so made until altered repealed or amended by a competent Legislature or other competent authority. Explanation.—In this section the expression “appropriate Government” means as respects any law relating to a matter enumerated in the Union List the Central Government and as respects any other law in its application to a State the State 88. Power to construe laws.—Notwithstanding that no provision or insufficient provision has been made under section 87 for the adaptation of a law made before the appointed day any court tribunal or authority required or empowered to enforce such law may for the purpose of facilitating its application in relation to the State of Uttar Pradesh or Uttaranchal construe the law in such manner without affecting the substance as may be necessary or proper in regard to the matter before the court tribunal or authority.” 27. By virtue of Section 28 of the Reorganization Act9 the newly established Uttarakhand High Court had the jurisdiction powers and authority in respect of the law in force immediately before the appointed day which was exercisable by the Allahabad High Court. 28. A comprehensive reading of the provisions of the Reorganization Act would show that the laws in force in the erstwhile state of UP continued to remain operative upon the creation of the new state of Uttarakhand. Section 87 only had the effect of obliging the state and the courts to thereafter enforce the existing laws to the extent they were modified within a period of 2 years from the date of commencement of the Reorganization Act. If the appellants are correct the mere omission of a law or regulation in the adaptation order would have the disastrous effect of creating a vacuum in regard to existing laws that are not specifically mentioned. In other words the power 928. Jurisdiction of Uttaranchal High Court.—The High Court of Uttaranchal shall have in respect of any part of the territories included in the State of Uttaranchal all such jurisdiction powers and authority as under the law in force immediately before the appointed day are exercisable in respect of that part of the said territories by the High Court at to adapt only meant that such laws which required some modifications or adaptations could be so modified or adapted within the period defined i.e. 2 years. In the absence of any such exercise of adaptation or modification all the laws rules regulations and statutory orders that were in force in the state of UP applied without any change This court holds to be unmerited the arguments of the appellant that the state was bound by the criteria specified in the advertisement issued by it in March 2016 even though Clause 7 of that notification clearly specified that the recruitments for ANMs would be in accordance with the statutory rules. The omission to mention the relevant qualificationsdid not relieve the state from its obligation to follow existing rules. It has not been disputed that the 1997 Rules after amendment in 1998 mandated that candidates desirous of being recruited as ANM or Health Workers had to possess educational qualifications including Intermediate passwith the science stream apart from the necessary ANM certificate course. That condition remained unchanged even after the creation of the State of Uttarakhand. It was only in 2016 after the advertisement for the concerned recruitment was published that the rules were changed the changed new rules relieved the requirement of having to qualify the Intermediate level with science subjects for the period 2010 2013 and thereafter after July 2016. For all other periods the basic educational qualification of intermediate or equivalent pass with a mandatory science stream qualification remained an essential condition. Therefore the argument that the state was bound by the standards it specified4 SCC 18 at the stage of recruitment. That the INC Act allows the council to prescribe standards for education which it legitimately exercises for the purposes of recognizing nursing courses in no way detracts or undermines the authority of the state to prescribe other eligibility conditions which candidates can and should possess as a condition precedent for recruitment purposes in the exercise of its power under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. As held in Sanjay Kumar Manjul v. UPSC11 “25. The statutory authority is entitled to frame the statutory rules laying down the terms and conditions of service as also the qualifications essential for holding a particular post. It is only the authority concerned which can take ultimate decision therefore 26. The jurisdiction of the superior courts it is a trite law would be to interpret the rule and not to supplant or supplement the same.” Therefore this court perceives no conflict between the provisions of the INC Act and the recruitment rules which were in force in the state of Uttarakhand from the time of its creation in 2000 till 2016 when the rules were changed after the advertisement in question for the recruitments was issued which this court is now called upon to Turning to the appellants’ argument regarding their right to be appointed according to batch wise seniority it is noticeable that by Rule 5 of the old 1997 Rules as amended as well as in the 2016 Rules there is no automatic recruitment the post of Health Worker ANM is to be filled by direct recruitment the selection procedure is as contemplated by Rule 15whereby a three member selection committee would recommend for selection having due regard to the year wise allocation of vacancies persons eligible for appointment having regard to the qualifications held by them by batch wise seniority8 SCC 42 the dates on which training is completed). This mode of selection does not eliminate the requirement of the rule prescribing essential qualifications nor does it relieve any candidate from the obligation to apply for the post and face the scrutiny of the committee for her candidature. In the present case 440 vacancies were advertised they were to be considered together obviously in respect of older vacancies which arose for previous years the qualifications applicable for the vacancy years were applicable None of the appellants disputed that they were ineligible in terms of the old rules as they did not hold the requisite intermediate qualifications in the science stream. The appellants’ contention in this regard too consequently fails In view of the foregoing conclusions there is no merit in these appeals they are dismissed without any order on costs. L.

He asked for roznamcha which was stated tobe computerized. Thereafter he visited the lockup but foundnobody inside the lockup. Then the Warrant Officer along withpetitioner checked adjoining room. There he found two ladiessitting on the bed along with a lady constable namely RajwantKaur. The petitioner identified the ladies as her mother andsister. The Warrant Officer asked them as to how they reachedpolice station and what they were doing there. Harvinder Kaurstated that she and her daughter Rupinder Kaur were broughtthere by the police personnel of Ropar police station from theirvillage on 02.09.2019 at 11.30 p.m. She also informed that herhusband was involved in a case which was registered at PoliceStation Sadar Morinda under Section 302 IPC and as he wasabsconding they were not living at their residence.

The police was enquiring againand again about her father namely Parvinder Singh. The Ld. Single Judge concluded that the report ofthe Warrant Officer showed that both the detenues had beendetained in the police station City Ropar illegally withoutfollowing any procedure as per law. Even if it was acceptedthat some persons had tried to cause harm to them even then both of them could not be kept in the police station for two dayswithout even making entry in the roznamcha and also withoutinforming the District Illaqa Magistrate. The detenues had notbeen produced before any Court of law which clearly show on 08 10 CRWP 777 2019(O&M) 3 that they had been illegally detained in the police station toprocure the presence of Parvinder Singh in a murder case. Holding that it was a gross violation of fundamentalrights of the citizens it was opined that action needed to betaken against the erring officials and the detneues needed to becompensated. The matter was referred to a larger Bench forissuing guidelines issuing directions etc. to protect thefundamental rights of the citizens.” 2.In the reply filed by way of affidavit of AssistantSuperintendent of Police Sub division Rupnagar it has been stated that thepolice officers of Police Station City Rupnagar had not illegally detained thealleged detenues. 3.It is stated that on 02.09.2019 one complaint by HarwinderKaurwas received in Police Station Morinda DistrictRupnagar in which she stated that the articles lying in her house were beingstolen by Simranjit Singh Kaka Singh Sodhi Singh etc. On this SISimranjeet Singh along with other officials aforesaid Harwinder Kaur andher daughter Rupinder Kaur went to the spot on his official vehicle PB 12 M6619.

The crowd did not let SI SimaranjeetSingh other officials and Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur to come out ofthe house. Kaka Singh etc. attacked ASI Darshan Singh and the police party.ASI Darshan Singh was injured and his uniform was torn. SI SHO informedthe Deputy Superintendent of Police Chamkaur Sahib on phone uponwhich SI Sunil Kumar SHO Police Station City Morinda along with policeforce SHO Chamkaur Sahib Inspector Gursewak Singh along with policeforce and Sukhjeet Singh Deputy Superintendent of Police ChamkaurSahib reached the spot.

Furthermore both Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur in their statements nowhere statedany kind of maltreatment or harassment meted out to them in Police Station.5.We have heard Ld. Counsel for the parties. 6.As observed by the Ld. Single Judge even if it is accepted thatsome persons had tried to cause harm to the detenues even then both ofthem could not be kept in the police station for two days without evenmaking entry in the roznamcha and also without informing the District IllaqaMagistrate.

Kolkata Sadar Kolkata …. …. CORAM :HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE GAUTAM KUMAR CHOUDHARY For the Appellants For the Respondents CAV ON 03. 02.2022 : Mr. Mahesh Tewari Advocate : Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha Advocate PRONOUNCED ON 10.02. 2022 This appeal is filed under Section 23 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act 1987 against the judgement dated 16.09.2009 passed by the learned Member Judicial) Railway Claims Tribunal Ranchi Bench Ranchi in Case No. OR 70011 2007 in favour of respondent named herein directing the appellant to refund Rs. 3 71 328 to the respondents along with interest @ 6% per annum from 01.11.2006 till the date of payment and also cost. The respondent applicant manufactures pretressed concrete sleepers for the Indian Railways. It is the case of the respondent that with the permission of the Railway Board 1240 MT of special cement was purchased from M s. Ambuja Cement Eastern Ltd. This consignment was booked in 20 Wagons. The consignment was loaded from the site of dispatch i.e. Bhatapara and the weight of the 20 wagons was 1241.00 M.T. Before reaching the destination site i.e. Jagadishpur when the consignment was re weighed it was found the net weight to be 1355.40 M.T. In view of the overloading a punitive charges amounting to Rs. 3 71 328 was raised against the respondent. The Respondent moved the Railway claim Tribunal for refund of the punitive charge under Section 16 of Railway Claim Tribunal Act 1987 which has been allowed on the basis of Annexure 5 which showed that weight of the cement was 1224.96 MT recorded by the Chief Goods Clerk MRLB Bhatapara under 2 South Eastern Railways in the presence of the authorized agent of Ambuja Cement Eastern Ltd. The overloading was found en route without notice to the applicant The appellant earlier moved this Court in W.P.(C) No. 274 2009 challenging the order of the Railway Tribunal which was dismissed vide order dated was wrong. The appellant moved the Hon’ble Court in L.P.A No.4910 and their Lordships vide order dated 11.01.2011 were pleased to permit the appellant to withdraw the appeal. It was held by their Lordships that the appellant will have right to move the Appellate forum and if the appeal is filed then question of limitation will be sympathetically considered. The order has been assailed on the ground that punitive charge for the onward distance from Bhaga to Jagdishpur was assessed on the difference between the net weight at Santhaldih weighbridge of 1355.40 and the chargeable weight of It is argued on behalf of the appellant that by the order number RCT DLI Judl.Policy 2002 2003 dated 19.11.2007 of Railways claims Tribunal 13 15 Moldova daily the pecuniary jurisdiction of the concerned single member bench is restricted to ₹ 2 lakhsexcept in untoward and train accident cases. According to the proviso to Section 4(4) of the Railways Claims Criminal Act 1987 the single member should have referred transferred the matter to a bench of two members that he is a division bench when the nature of the matter so demands. Apart from the jurisdictional issue raised it is also argued that there is provision to re weigh and there was nothing wrong on the part of the Railway authorities to have a reweighed the consignment. During rebooking of the consignment from Bhatapara to Jagdishpur the punitive charges were paid by respondent without any objection and without any protest. Once the excess weight had been accepted and got the same rebooked the plea against overloading and consequent punitive charges cannot be raised. It is further argued that in LPA No. 4910 the Hon’ble court was pleased to permit the appellant to withdraw the appeal and the writ and therefore the order passed by Hon’ble. the single Judge in the writ petition does not bar the appellant from preferring the instant appeal. It is submitted by the learned counsel on behalf of the respondent that Hon’ble single Bench in W.P.(C) No. 274 of 2010 by the order dated 8th September 2010 had already confirmed the order of the tribunal and dismissed the 3 As far as the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction of the Tribunal is concerned from the plain reading of the order passed in LPA No. 4910 it is apparent that earlier order passed by the Hon’ble single Judge in W.P.(C) No. 2710 has not been interfered with and therefore cannot be reopened in this appeal. It was held by the Hon’ble single Judge that the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction ought to have been raised at the earliest stage. I also concur with this finding in view of Section 21(2) of the CPC that objection as to competence of a Court with reference to the pecuniary limits of its jurisdiction cannot be allowed in appeal or revision unless the objection was taken in the Court of first instance at the earliest opportunity. 10. Coming to the merit of the appeal the matter for consideration is whether the Railways had the right to reweigh the consignment and whether the necessary procedure was followed. Section 78 of the Railways Act 1989 lays down specific power to reweigh the consignment. The provision reads as under: 78. Power to measure weigh etc.—Notwithstanding anything contained in the railway receipt the railway administration may before the delivery of the consignment have the right to— i) re measure re weigh or re classify any consignment ii) recalculate the freight and other charges and iii) correct any other error or collect any amount that may have been omitted to be charged. From the above provision it is manifest that the Railways was within its right to reweigh the consignment. This extract is taken from Union of India v. Shree Shiv Sai Steel Industries 2019 SCC OnLine Gau 5715 :1 Gau LR 426 :203 AIC9 at page 428 4. A bare reading of section 73 of the Railways Act 1989 would go to show that whenever there is an excess loading of the goods beyond the permissible carrying capacity the railway administration may in addition to the freight and other charges recover from the consigners consignee or the endorsee as the case may be charges by way of penalty on such rates as may be prescribed before the delivery of the goods. The relevant aspect of section 73 is that the recovery of the penalty that may be imposed can be made before the delivery of the goods concerned. The object of having the salutary provision for levying penal charges for overloading has been explained by the Hon’ble Apex Court in Jagjit Cotton Textile Mills v. Chief Commercial Supdt. N.R. 5 SCC 126 at page 147 while upholding the constitutionality it was observed: “42. In our view these contentions are not tenable. As has been noticed in our discussion on Points 1 and 2 the railway statutes define “maximum carrying capacity” “normal carrying capacity”and the “permissible carrying capacity”. 4 No wagon can be loaded beyond the maximum carrying capacity. The wagon could not ordinarily be loaded beyond the normal carrying capacity or up to any upward variation thereof and this limit is called the permissible carrying capacity. Section 73 of the new Act and Rule 161 A of the old Rules permit loading in excess of the permissible carrying capacity without any penal charges now up to a limit of 2 tonnes.What is now subjected to a penal charge is the excess over and above the permissible level above stated which is always below the maximum limit. In our view this levy under Section 73 of the new Act and the old Rule 161 A is intended for dual purposes — one is to see that the gross weight at the axles is not unduly heavy so that accidents on account of the axles breaking down could be prevented. The other reason behind the collection is that inasmuch as the wagon has carried such excess load up to the destination point at the other end the replacement cost of the coaches engines or rails or of repairs to the bridges be covered”. 11. The main ground on which the application for refund has been allowed by the learned Tribunal is that none of the representative were present at the time when the consignment was being reweighed. The impugned order is laconic and has allowed the refund of penalty for overloading merely on the ground that no representative was present. Section 73 specifically provides that the railway administration may reweigh the consignment and recalculate the freight and other charges before the delivery of the goods. During rebooking of the consignment from Bhatapara to Jagdishpur the punitive charges were paid by respondent without any objection and without any protest. In any case when the goods are en route it will be highly unpracticable to detain the consignment until the representative of the consignor comes and presents before re weighment is done. Re weighment is a statutory right of the railway administration to check all short of malpractices and a clog on this cannot be imposed by laying down unrealistic conditionalities like presence of the consignor at the time of reweighment. Considering the length and breadth of our country and the span in which the railways network is spread out is it possible to detain the goods train enroute till the representative arrives there The impugned order does not cite any rule or circular in support of such a requirement. Under the circumstance the impugned order is not sustainable and is accordingly set aside. The appeal is allowed. Consequently I.A. No.4511 stands disposed of. Gautam Kumar Choudhary J.)

Non Reportable IN THE CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Criminal Appeal No. 319 Viram @ Virma .... Appellant The State of Madhya Pradesh …. Respondent W I T H Criminal Appeal No.319 JUDGMENT L. NAGESWARA RAO J. 1. These Criminal Appeals are directed against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior by which the conviction of the Appellants under Sections 147 302 149 325 149 324 149 323 149 and their sentences were upheld. On the oral report given by Solal son of GirdhariFIR No.495 was registered at Police Station Kumbhraj Guna Madhya Pradesh. The informant Solal son of Girdhari stated that Babulal Lodha son of Prabhulal Lodha and Shankarlal had an altercation with Shriram and others during the day time on 19.08.1995. After sunset Shriram Sarpanch Biram 1 | P a g e Devlal Gyarasiram Shrilal Gangaram Kamarlal Ramesh Nathulal Laxminarayan Sholal son of Gopal Lodhi Kanhaiyalal Moolchand Navneet Ram Daula Bhima Hiralal Dhurya Bansilal Hazari Parmanand Bala Bux son of Balram Ram Narayan Lodha armed with farsa lathi ballam spear and sword attacked Shankarlaland Babulal Lodha. The informant along with RodibaiShantibaiPana BaiBabulal S o Girdhari PW 6) Bala Bux Panchulaland Kesharbai PW 9) rushed to rescue Shankarlal and Babulal son of Prabhulal Lodha. Shriram Devlal Gyarasi Shrilal Kamarlal Ramesh @ Barya Nathulal Sholal son of Gopal Lodhi Kanhaiyalal Daula @ Daulatram Bhima Hira Lal Hazari Parmanand Bala Bux son of Balram Ramnarayan Laxmi Narayan and Viram @ Virma assaulted the informant and others who reached the place of incident with farsa spear and sword and inflicted injuries on their heads legs back and other parts of the body. The Appellants were charged under Section 302 and 324 IPC alternatively under Sections 147 302 149 324 149 329 149 IPC. There were a total of 21 accused apart from the two juveniles Ram Narayan and Kanhaiya Lal. 14 witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution. 2 | P a g e On a consideration of the evidence adduced by the prosecution the Trial Court held the accused guilty of committing offences under Section 147 302 149 for committing murder of Babulal and under Sections 325 149 324 149 323 149 for voluntarily causing hurt to RodibaiShantibai Pana Bai Babulal S o Girdhari PW 6) Bala BuxPanchulaland KesharbaiSolal son of Girdhariand Shankarlalthe other witnesses reached the place of occurrence after the accused assaulted Babulal son of Prabhulal and Shankarlal. However the Trial Court found that the oral testimony of Shankarlalis creditworthy and there is sufficient corroboration from the ocular evidence of the other injured witnesses. The Trial Court observed that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the injured eye witnesses are trivial and their evidence cannot be rejected on that ground. According to the Trial Court a cumulative reading of the oral testimony of the injured eye witnesses conclusively proved that the accused inflicted a 3 | P a g e fatal injury on the head of the deceased Babulal. The injury certificates and the oral testimonies of Dr. A.D. Bhindurkar PW 13) and Dr. Sitaram Singhwas scrutinized by the Trial Court and the submission on behalf of the defence that there is a contradiction between the ocular testimony of the witnesses and the medical evidence was rejected. The High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the Appellants by holding that there was no error committed by the Trial Court. The discrepancies in the statements made by the witnesses in Court were held to be minor in nature on the basis of which the Appellants cannot be said to be not guilty The attack made by all the accused on the deceased Babulal and the injured witnesses has been narrated by them in one voice though with some minor variations. DaulalBhimaHazariBala Bux son of BalramMool Chandand Hira Lalhave died. Vanshilal Navneet Ram Dhurya Shrilal Kamarlal Ramesh Nathulal Sholal son of Gopal LodhiViramand Shriramare before this Court in the above Appeals. The Appellants contended that the depositions of all the witnesses is not supported by medical evidence in respect of the nature of injuries number of injuries and the nature of weapons that were used by the accused. Reliance was placed 4 | P a g e on judgments of this Court in Amar Singh v. State of Punjab1 and Ram Narain Singh v. State of Punjab2 to submit that the incongruity in the statements of the eye witnesses and the medical evidence is vital and the accused are entitled for acquittal. The Appellants submitted that only Shankarlal was a witness to the assault on the deceased and all the other injured eye witnesses admittedly arrived at the scene of occurrence later. Therefore their evidence cannot be relied upon by the prosecution to convict the Appellants under Section 302 read with 149 IPC. Yet another point raised on behalf of the Appellants is that the ingredients of Section 149 IPC have not been made out and the Appellants could not have been convicted with the aid of Section 149 IPC. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant contended that in any event conviction under Section 302 149 is harsh and excessive and an alternate conviction under Section 326 149 may be imposed if the Court is inclined to uphold the judgment of the High Court. The case of the prosecution is that interference with the judgments of the Courts below is unwarranted in view of the abundant evidence on record. Shankarlalis an eye witness to the murder of Babulal. The other injured eye witnesses corroborated the statement of PW 11. The 11 SCC 679 24 SCC 497 5 | P a g e inconsistencies and discrepancies in the evidence of all the eye witnesses are trivial and cannot be resorted by the Appellants to their benefit. Though there are certain inconsistencies between the oral testimony of the witnesses and medical evidence the Appellants cannot seek reversal of the judgments of the Courts below in view of the overwhelming oral evidence on record. It is well settled law that this Court does not normally re appreciate the evidence unless the assessment of the High Court is vitiated by an error of law or procedure or is based on error of record misreading of evidence or is inconsistent with the evidence. This Court does not enter into credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court3. Having scrutinised the record of the courts below we are of the considered view that there is no error committed by them. The death of deceased Babulal was caused due to the attack by the Appellants. However the submission of the Appellants that there is a contradiction in the oral testimonies and the medical evidence requires consideration. Shankarlalwho is an injured witness stated that he has seen the accused persons beating the deceased Babulal. According to him Shriram gave a sword blow on the head of Babulal. DhurilalRamesh4 SCC 158 6 | P a g e 9) Bala Bux son of Balramand others gave farsa blow to Babulal. When confronted with the statement recorded by the Police under Section 161 Cr. P.C. the said witness submitted that he had stated to the Police about the aforementioned covert acts and he is not aware as to why this has not been mentioned in his statement. The other witnesses corroborated the statement of PW 11 and also spoke about the injuries caused to them by the Appellants Dr. A.D. Bhindurkar stated that the deceased was brought to the hospital at 03:15 AM on 20.08.1995 and he found the following injuries on his person: 1. “A torn wound in Y shape measuring 8 cm x 1.2 cm x 1.5 cm located on the skin in the region of left parietal bone which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt 2. A bluish mark along with abrasion measuring 1 x 0.5 cm · located towards rear side on the joint of right elbow which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt 3. A bluish mark along with abrasion measuring 2 x 2 cm below left knee in the front region which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt weapon 4. A bluish mark measuring 8 x 3 cm located on left side of chest towards front which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt weapon. 7 | P a g e 5. A bluish mark on multiple areas measuring 12 cm x 3 cm located on the back which appears to have been inflicted by hard and blunt weapon.” Dr. A.D. Bhindurkar was of the opinion that injury No.1 was fatal and all the other injuries are simple in nature. He has also stated that the injuries were likely to have been inflicted by truncheon or luhangi. Babulal son of Prabhulal Lodha succumbed to the injuries suffered by him. According to PW 13 the injuries were caused by hard and blunt weapon. Sriram who was carrying a sword RameshDaulal @ Daulatramand Mool Chandwere carrying farsas and Sholal son of Gopal Lodhiwas armed with a ballam. The remaining accused were having sticks in their hands. Apart from some minor aberrations in the testimony of the injured eye witnesses they were consistent in speaking about the weapons that were used by the accused. The oral evidence discloses that there was an indiscriminate attack by the accused on the deceased and the other injured eye witnesses. As found by the Courts below there is a contradiction between the oral testimony of the witnesses and the medical evidence. In Amar Singh v State of Punjab this Court examined the point relating to inconsistencies between the oral evidence and the 8 | P a g e medical opinion. The medical report submitted therein established that there were only contusions abrasions and fractures but there was no incised wound on the left knee of the deceased as alleged by a witness. Therefore the evidence of the witness was found to be totally inconsistent with the medical evidence and that would be sufficient to discredit the entire prosecution case In the instant case the fatal injury was caused by a hard and blunt weapon on the left parietal bone. There is no corresponding injury to the weapons used by RameshDaulal @ Daulatram Mool Chandand Shriram A 20). Therefore the conviction of the Appellants under Section 302 149 is not justified. However there is abundant evidence on record to show that the Appellants attacked the deceased and the injured witnesses with deadly weapons Therefore the Appellants are liable to be convicted under Section 326 read with 149 IPC. 11. The conviction of the Appellants under Sections 325 149 324 149 323 149 is confirmed. We are informed that the Appellants have undergone a sentence of four and half years In the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the opinion that a sentence of seven years under Section 326 149 would meet the ends of justice. 9 | P a g e 12. While upholding the judgment of the High Court regarding the conviction and sentence of the Appellants under Sections 325 149 324 149 323 149 and the sentence imposed for such offences we convert the conviction under Sections 302 149 to 326 149 and sentence from life imprisonment to seven years. Needless to say that we are not expressing any view on the validity of Section 149 IPC which question is left open. 13. The Appeals are partly allowed. [L. NAGESWARA RAO B. V.
