"Section 86(1)(f) vests a statutory jurisdiction with the State Electricity Commission to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration. therefore, the appointment of arbitrators by the commission overrides the appointment of arbitrators by the High Court. This judgment was passed in the case of Chief General Manager (IPC) M P Power Trading Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. Narmada Equipments Pvt. Ltd. [C.A.No.1051/2021] by a Bench consisting of Hon’ble Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Hon’ble Justice M R Shah, and Hon’ble Justice Sanjiv Khanna. The present appeal arose from a judgment passed by the MP High Court where it appointed an Arbitrator in the dispute between the parties, in an application filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. The MP Electricity Board entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in 1999 with the respondent and the latter was to establish a mini hydroelectric project on a built and operate basis. However, the PPA was terminated in 2001 by the Board. The respondent initially filed a writ petition challenging the termination of the PPA, wherein the High Court, declined to entertain the petition in view of an arbitration agreement or clause in the PPA. the respondent filed a review petition which was also dismissed by the High Court. the respondent, therefore, issued a notice to the board seeking to resolve the dispute by mutual discussion. Since the respondent did not receive a reply to the notice in 2011, the respondent issued another notice to the Board. The respondent stated that if the Board did not act upon the notice within 30 days of its receipt, it would approach the High Court under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act. having received no reply, the respondent approached the High Court. The appointed arbitrators refused to initiate the proceeding since their fees had not been paid. The respondents filed an AC under which the Single Judge held that remedies under Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Electricity Act and under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act are independent of each other, and it was open to the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 11(6). Therefore the Appellant appealed before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court observed that section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act, is a special provision that overrides the general provisions contained in Section 11 of the 1996 Act. Section 86(1)(f) vests a statutory jurisdiction with the State Electricity Commission to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration. Further Section 174 of the Electricity Act, provides an overriding effect to the 1996 Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the 2003 Act itself. The Supreme Court further held that if there is an inherent lack of jurisdiction, the plea can be taken at any stage and also in collateral proceedings. The Court reiterated a well-established principle that a decree passed by a court without subject matter jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon. Such a defect of jurisdiction cannot be cured even by the consent of the parties. Therefore the State Electricity Commission had jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator since Section 86(1)(f) refers to disputes only between licensees and generating companies. Thus, the order of the High Court appointing an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act is unsustainable. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the order of the High Court was set aside.",The Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the respondent under which it was to establish a mini hydro electric project on a built and operate basis. The PPA was terminated by the Board under Clause 12.1 of the PPA seeking to resolve the dispute by

This is in connection with Muffasil PS Case No. 114 of 2021 dated 23.02.2021. This judgment was given in the high court of Judicature at Patna by honorable Mr. Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah on the 6th  of August 2021 in the case of Munni Devi and others versus the state of Bihar criminal miscellaneous No.37739 of 2021, Mr. Ajay Kumar Represented as the advocate for the petitioner and Mr. Md. Arif represented the state of Bihar as the additional Public Prosecutor, Mr. Nasrul Huda was represented as the advocate for the informant the proceedings of the court were held via video conference. The following are the facts of the case, petitioner no.1 and 2 were accused of assaulting the mother of the informant using an iron rod and stick, and allegations of snatching gold jewelry was also made, petitioner no.3 was accused of assaulting the sister of the informant and all the petitioners along with the family members entered the house of the informant and looted Rs. 27,000 and petitioner no.4 had bitten the sister of the informant, the petitioners further damaged the motorcycle using an iron rod and stones and took three mobile phones from the house of the informant, the father of the informant was killed because of the assault committed by the petitioners. The counsel for the petitioner held that both the families were agnates. according to the FIR, no reason has been stated on why such an event took place, the accused has also filed a case against the informant Muffasil PS Case No. 115 of 2021 on the same day, as the informant along with his family teased and harassed one of the petitioners and when the family were involved and confronted the informant they were attacked, the deceased is the own uncle of the co-accused and the parties are neighbors. The allegations were falsely implicated because there was no injury report for the attack on the mother and regarding the sister, according to the injury report, only one lacerated wound above the left half upper lip 1” x 1/2” and no sign of bite was found by the doctor. All the petitioners are females and have no criminal antecedent they have been implicated with ulterior motive and the death of the father of the informant was caused by the co-accused and not the petitioners. The APP held that the petitioners were accused of assaulting the mother and biting the sister of the informant, counsel for the informant held that the father of the informant died due to the injuries resulting from the assault. However, it is not controverted that the assault on the deceased was done by the co-accused and not the petitioners and also there is no injury report for the attack on the mother of the informant. After considering the facts and circumstances of the case the Patna High Court held that “the allegations against the petitioners, who have been made accused along with their other male members, are not corroborated by the material brought before the police and as the petitioners are ladies without any criminal antecedent, the Court is inclined to allow their prayer for grant of pre-arrest bail.”",The petitioners were arrested in connection with Muffasil PS Case No. 1121 dated 23.02.2021 under Sections 147 148 149 341 323 324 448 379 302 427 354 of the Indian Penal Code.

This petition is in connection with Dinara PS Case No. 9 of 2020 dated 03.01.2020. It is the second attempt for bail by the petitioner which was rejected by the judgment passed Criminal Misc. No. 20913 of 2020. In the high court of Judicature at Patna, this judgement was given by honourable Mr Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah on the 25th of August 2021 in the case of Jabbar Miyan @ Jabbar Miya and others versus the state of Bihar, criminal miscellaneous No. 19491 of 2021. Mr Md. Mushtaque represented as the advocate for the petitioner, and Mr Ajay Kumar Jha represented the state of Bihar as the additional Public Prosecutor, the proceedings of the court were held via video conference. The following are the facts of the case, the petitioners were accused because he had kept the informant and two other girls in his house and did not allow them to go out. The petitioner runs a dance troupe and he attempted to commit immoral acts and human trafficking where he did not succeed and he had taken the informant’s signature on a blank paper after threatening them and told them the informant has been bought for Rs. 30,000. The counsel representing the petitioner held that according to the FIR the informant stated that she was held for 10 days and she was allowed to go out only by fulfilling the contract agreement which was dancing and singing at various functions and the counsel held that the FIR was filed few days after due to money dispute. The counsel provided a supplementary affidavit as evidence to prove the same. The counsel held that the allegations against the petitioners have been falsely implicated and the informant and other girls had taken the money in order to perform in the dance troupe however slater on the informants neither wanted to perform nor return the money and lodged this false case. The counsel submitted that according to the allegations there was no wrongful act and the girls were kept inside as they belonged from outside the state and they were taken care of properly and even after medical examination there was no wrong found out and the petitioner has been held in custody since the 4th of January 2020. Further, the counsel held that the entire family and their livelihood which they depend on has been damaged due to this false accusation and incarceration, therefore, the court is required to impose conditions to release the petitioner on bail. The additional public prosecutor held that the petitioners have been directly accused by the informants who are the girls that they were confined wrongfully and against their wish and did not allow them to leave and the petitioner also tried to commit human trafficking. The court held that after considering the facts and circumstances of the case the court held that taking into consideration that there is evidence to indicate that there was a professional relationship between the petitioner and the girls which may have gone sour and most importantly, actual physical abuse not being alleged and the allegation being only that the petitioner had tried to commit immoral act but could not succeed, the Court is inclined to grant bail to the petitioner. The court concluded that “the petitioner will be released on bail upon furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned SDJM, in PS Case No. 09 of 2020 subject to the conditions under section 438 (2) Cr.P.C.

Any violation of the terms and conditions of the bonds or the undertaking shall lead to the cancellation of his bail bonds. The petition stands disposed of in the aforementioned terms.”",The petitioner is in custody in connection with Dinara PS Case No. 9 of 2020 dated 03.01.2020 instituted under Sections 344 366 370(3) 120 B of the Indian Penal Code and 3(a)(b) 4 5(a) of the Immoral Traffic Act
"In matters concerning administrative appointments, the seniority of the transferee shall prevail as opposed to the direct recruits if the seniority predates the vacancy generated for the office of the latter. A bench comprising of Rajiv Sahai, J. and Amit Bansal J. observed in the matter of Yash Rattan v Union of India [W.P.(C) 3576/2021] that seniority shall not be claimed to a public office prior to induction into cadre. The petitioners herein were appointed as Inspectors in the Delhi Commissionerate of the respondents in the year 2016 under the direct recruit quota. The private respondents (who were the petitioners before the CAT) were also direct recruits recruited in the year 2011 in various zones outside Delhi. At their request, they were transferred to the Delhi Zone in the year 2014. The main ground of challenge in the OA No. 2955/2019 was that the petitioners who had joined the department after the joining of the private respondents cannot be placed above them in the seniority list. The CAT set aside the seniority list, subsequent to which the present writ petition has been filed. The counsel contending on behalf of the petitioners relied on the judgment of Union of India v N.R. Parmar ((2012) 13 SCC 340) and opined that the recruitment year would be the year of initiating the recruitment process against a vacancy year. The corresponding counsel pointed out that the judgment in N.R. Parmar stood prospectively overruled in K. Meghachandra Singh &amp;Ors. Vs. Nigam Siro &amp; Ors ((2020) 5 SCC 689). He further added that seniority position was not settled when the K. Meghachandra Singh judgment was delivered, as the private respondents had filed objections against the seniority list of 15th March, 2018 and further had challenged the same before the CAT before the K. Meghachandra Singh judgment was delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Therefore, it is wrong to state that the seniority position was settled. The Court after a careful reading of the K. Meghachandra judgment followed through that seniority of direct recruits had to be fixed from the date of appointment and not from the date of initiation of the recruitment process, and any person aspiring to a vacant post does not have any vested right to it. The court further observed that “In service jurisprudence, seniority cannot be claimed from the date when the incumbent is yet to be borne in the cadre and therefore, norms on assessment of inter se seniority, suggested in N.R. Parmar case was disapproved; decision in N.R. Parmar case is overruled, however, the decision will not affect the inter se seniority already based on N.R. Parmar case and the same is protected. Decision will apply prospectively.”",The present writ petition impugns the order dated 13th October 2020 passed by Central Administrative Tribunalin OA No.2955 2019. The present petition has been filed by the petitioners who were the respondents before the CAT. The petitioners were appointed as Inspectors in the Delhi Commissionerate of the
"The facts and information of the suspected offences are not an encyclopedia that is to reveal all the facts and details. It doesn’t need an argument, and cannot be ruled out as a result, that the FIR is just an informant’s note on a recognizable offence. This auspicious judgment was passed by The High Court of Bombay in the Matter of Smt. Jayshri W/o Ratan Uchit vs The State of Maharashtra and others. [922 CRIMINAL APPLICATION NO. 1606 OF 2019] by Honorable Justice R.V. Ghuge &amp; Justice B. U. Debadwar. The facts of the case are that Ratan Uchit had been mentally and physically fit, committed suicide within just four months and six days, after marriage with the applicant, and two suicide notes, which the deceased Ratan Uchit had left behind, contended that the applicant was often engaged in quarrels with him. He was then fed up and committed suicide. Learned counsel for the applicant vehemently argued that FIR sought to be quashed has been registered for the offence of abetment to commit suicide punishable under section 306 of the I.P.C, and allegation about abetment made in the FIR is very much vague in nature. There are no charges are made under the FIR which suggests that, in accordance with that instigation, the applicant deliberately prompted her husband Ratan Uchit to commit suicide. Learned counsel for the respondents argued that Ratan Uchit had committed suicide only after four months and six days of the marriage performed with the applicant. She is a quarrelsome woman, she had mentally harassed her husband to a great extent by picking up quarrels with him frequently for petty reasons. The court relied on the case of “C.B.I. vs. Tapan Kumar Singh; the Honourable Supreme Court has held in paragraph 22 that “The law does not require the mentioning of all the ingredients of the offence in the FIR. It is only after completion of the investigation that it may be possible to say whether any offence is made out on the basis of the evidence collected by the investigating agency. It is observed that an FIR is not an encyclopedia that must disclose all the facts and details relating to the offence alleged to have been committed. It requires no debate that an FIR is merely a report by the informant about the commission of a cognizable offence and it cannot be ruled out that minute details may not be mentioned.” ","The allegations averments made in the FIR in short are that deceased RatanPandurang Uchit was elder brother of first informant Shankar Pandurang, who committed suicide after the death of his first wife, who was a Cancer patient. The allegations were made by the police through the"
"In the present strained circumstances, it is not in the interest of justice that a person be denied the opportunity to file an application for restoration of the case and the same must be treated on urgent basis by the authorities. The aforesaid has been established by the Delhi High Court in the case of Ajay Garg v. Delhi Development Authority [W.P.(C) 6033/2021 &amp; C.M APPLs. 19090-091/2021] which was decided by a single judge bench comprising Justice C. Hari Shankar on 28th June 2021. The facts of the case are as follows, It is stated that Suit No. 82888/2016 had been preferred by the petitioner before the learned Senior Civil Judge, Saket, challenging the proposal of the DDA to demolish the property of the petitioner located at D66/3, Gautam Nagar, New Delhi. Said suit was dismissed by the learned Senior Civil Judge, vide order dated 8th April, 2021, under Order XVII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Thereafter, the petitioner moved an application for restoration of the suit. Counsel for petitioner submitted that, as the presiding officer of the court which was dealing with the petitioner’s suit is not sitting, the application for restoration has not been listed. Given the present scenario, in which the trial courts are functioning only on a virtual and restricted mode, he submits that despite his client’s best efforts, it has not been possible to have the restoration application listed before the Court. Learned Standing Counsel for the DDA, submits that the property of the petitioner has already been demolished, though the said assertion is disputed by counsel for petitioner on instructions.","The petitioner moved an application for restoration of the suit which was dismissed by the learned Senior Civil Judge Saket, Delhi, challenging the proposal of the DDA to demolish the property of the petitioner located at D 66 3 Gautam Nagar New Delhi.

"On deciding a case regarding the contradiction of rules framed by the new and old state, the Supreme court decided that the state under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution empowered them to prescribe conditions, rules for employment as deemed appropriate apart from the already present enactments. This judgment was passed in the case of Suman Devi &amp; ors. vs. State of Uttarakhand and Ors. [C.A.No.554-557/2021], by a Single Bench consisting of Hon’ble Justice Ajay Mohan Goel. According to the facts of this case, the appellants were registered as Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM) and complained that the Uttarakhand High Court’s judgment regarding their ineligibility for appointment to the cadre of Family Health Worker (FHW), ANM, and Health Supervisor (HS) was erroneous. The erstwhile United Provinces enacted a law, the UP Law. The object of the UP Law was to provide for the registration of the nursing profession and was later amended, where the definition of ANM was inserted. The Indian Nursing Council (INC) was brought into force with the objective to set up a central council (Council) for a uniform standards of training. Section 11  of the INC Act, stated that notwithstanding other laws, any recognized qualification was to be sufficient qualification for enrolment in any State register. Rule 5 of UP framed the Uttar Pradesh Department of Medical Health and Family Welfare Health Worker and Health Supervisor (Male and Female) Service Rules, 1997 stated that direct recruitment through the Public Service Commission of Health Worker (Male) would be from male candidates who successfully completed the 1-year basic health worker training course conducted by the departmental divisional training centers of the state. For females, the rule 5(2) provided that they needed 1 and a half years of training conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council, Lucknow. Such candidates also had to be duly registered under the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council, Lucknow. However, it was apparently amended in 1998. The State of Uttarakhand was formed on re-organization of the State of U.P and adopted the laws of composite U.P. Thus, the 1997 Rules providing for recruitment of male and female Health Worker with the 1998 amendments, continued to remain in force in Uttarakhand. In 2007 the INC provided that the basic qualification for the Nursing Auxiliary program was the Secondary School Certificate Examination. In 2016 it was again amended to intermediate or equivalent (10+2 from a recognized board) in the science stream. Writ petitions were filed before the Uttarakhand High Court, questioning the advertisement and seeking a direction that the recruitment, to the extent it was contrary to the rules. After hearing both the parties, it was observed by the Supreme Court that there was no merit in the contention that the requirement of an intermediate in science stream did not exist since the adaptation order under the Reorganization Act omitted the rules framed by the erstwhile state of UP. The supreme court observed that the Reorganization Act provided for laws of the erstwhile state of UP to remain operative in Uttarakhand and section 87 had the effect of obliging the state and the courts to thereafter enforce the existing laws, to the extent they were modified within a period of 2 years from the date of commencement of the Reorganization Act. in other words the power to adapt only meant such laws which required some modifications or adaptations, could be so modified or adapted within the period defined, i.e., 2 years. The supreme court held that the state as a public employer s empowered by virtue of the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, to frame appropriate rules. These rules can prescribe conditions of service for various posts, classes of posts, and services under the state. The fact that INC Act allowed the council to prescribe conditions for uniformity is in no way undermining the authority of the state to prescribe other conditions. The court, therefore, concluded that it perceived no conflict between the provisions of the INC Act and the recruitment rules which were in force in the state of Uttarakhand from the time of its creation in 2000, till 2016 when the rules were changed after the advertisement in question for the recruitments was issued.",The Government of Uttarakhand had advertised on 15.03.2016 440 vacancies of FHW Female) and ANM relative to several years’ backlog. The advertisements were challenged as being contrary to the recruitment rules the challenge was upheld by a single judgeand whose decision was affirmed by the
"In the case of Parneet Kaur Vs State of Punjab and others [Criminal Writ Petition No.777 of 2019] High Court of Punjab and Haryana directed the respondent- State to pay a compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh) each to detenues Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur. The complainant informed the police about theft in her house. While the police reached the spot, it came across to them that husband of Harwinder Kaur and the father of the petitioner was charged in a case regarding murder. The husband Palwinder Singh was evading his arrest. While the police were inspecting the spot, few unknown men and women came there and started abusing and beating Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur. The police under the protection of female police officers tried to rescue Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur from the house, upon which the mob attacked them with sticks and stones with the intention to kill both the women. Failing in all the efforts, the Duty Magistrate ordered Lathi Charge on the crowd in order to save the lives of Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur. The mob caused damage to the government and private vehicles as well. After lot of struggle both women were rescued from the spot. Subsequently, the present criminal writ petition was filed for issuance of writ in the nature of habeas corpus to set detenues, Harvinder Kaur and her daughter Rupinder Kaur free and to produce them before this Court after conducting their medical examination from Civil Surgeon or any other competent authority, as the detenues were claimed to have been illegally detained by respondents. It was contended by the respondent that it was in good faith and in order to protect their lives from angry mob, they (the alleged detenues) had been permitted to stay back in Police Station City Rupnagar until the situation got normalized. It was pointed that both Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur in their statements nowhere stated any kind of maltreatment or harassment meted out to them in Police Station.","“The detenues had not been produced before any Court of law which clearly show on 08 10 CRWP 777 2019(O&M) 3 that they had been illegally detained in the police station toproc”, said the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in the matter of"
"Section 73 of the railway’s act, 1989 provides a statutory right to the railway administration to reweigh the consignment – Jharkhand High Court The present appeal under Section 23 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 against the judgment passed by railway claims tribunal to direct the appellant to refund Rs. 3,71,328/- to the respondents. The appeal is filed against the judgment and is heard and allowed by a single judge bench of HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE GAUTAM KUMAR CHOUDHARY in the case of Union of India versus M/s. Muva Industries Ltd and Ors. (M.A. No. 30 of 2011) The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that by the order number RCT/DLI/Judl.Policy/2002-2003 of railway claims tribunal,13/15 Moldova daily. the pecuniary jurisdiction of the concerned single bench is restricted to ₹ 2 lakhs (Rupees Two Lakhs), except in untoward and train accident cases, and according to the proviso to Section 4(4) of the Railways Claims Criminal Act 1987, the single-member should have referred/transferred the matter to a bench of two members to a division bench as the matter demands and apart from the jurisdiction issue raised it was also submitted that there is provision to re-weigh and there was nothing wrong on the part of the Railway authorities to have a reweighed the consignment and during rebooking of the consignment the punitive charges were paid by the respondent without any objection and once the excess weight is accepted then the plea against overloading and consequent punitive charges cannot be raised. It was further argued that in LPA No. 493 of 2010, the Hon’ble Court was pleased to permit the appellant to withdraw the appeal and the writ and therefore the order passed by Hon’ble. the single Judge in the writ petition does not bar the appellant from preferring the instant appeal. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submits that the Hon’ble single Bench in W.P.(C) No. 274 of 2010 has already confirmed the order of the tribunal and dismissed the writ. And as far the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction is concerned it is apparent from the order passed in LPA No. 493 of 2010 and the earlier order passed by Hon’ble single Judge in W.P.(C) No. 274 of 2010 has not been interfered with and therefore cannot be reopened in this appeal. The respondent also submits that Section 21(2) of the CPC and that objection as to the competence of a Court regarding the pecuniary limits of its jurisdiction cannot be allowed in appeal or revision unless the objection was taken in the Court of the first instance at the earliest opportunity. The court finds merit in the appeal and the matters into consideration that whether the Railways had the right to reweigh the consignment and whether the necessary procedure was followed. Section 78 of the Railways Act 1989 lays down specific power to reweigh the consignment and relies on the case of Union of India v. Shree Shiv Sai Steel Industries, 2019 SCC OnLine Gau 5715 : (2020) 1 Gau LR 426 : (2019) 203 AIC (Sum 20) 9 at page 428 and on the case of Jagjit Cotton Textile Mills v. Chief Commercial Supdt., N.R., (1998) 5 SCC 126 at page 147 and finds and main ground which the application for refund has been allowed by the learned Tribunal is that none of the representatives were present at the time when the consignment was being reweighed. Section 73 of the railway’s act specifically provides that the railway administration may reweigh the consignment and recalculate the freight and other charges before the delivery of the goods and makes it a statutory right of railway administration to consider all sorts of malpractices and under the impugned circumstances of the case the present appeal is allowed and the impugned order was set aside.",It is the case of the respondent that with the permission of the Railway Board 1240 MT of special cement was purchased from M s. Ambuja Cement Eastern Ltd. (M.S. Muva Industries Ltd) and the consignment was booked in 20 Wagons. The consignment of
"It is well settled law that this Court does not normally reappreciate the evidence unless the assessment of the High Court is vitiated by an error of law or procedure or is based on error of record, misreading of evidence or is inconsistent with the evidence. This Court does not enter into credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court through the learned bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao in the case of Viram @ Virma v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (Criminal Appeal No. 31 of 2019)( Criminal Appeal No.32 of 2019). The brief facts of the case are that These Criminal Appeals are directed against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior by which the conviction of the Appellants under Sections 147, 302/149, 325/149, 324/149, 323/149 and their sentences were upheld. On the oral report given by Solal son of Girdhari (PW-10), FIR No.48 of 1995 was registered at Police Station Kumbhraj, Guna, Madhya Pradesh. The informant Solal son of Girdhari stated that Babulal Lodha had an altercation with Shriram and others during the day time on 19.08.1995. After sunset, the appellants armed with lathi, ballam, spear and sword attacked Shankarlal (PW-11) and Babulal Lodha. The informant along with others rushed to rescue Shankarlal (PW-11) and Babulal. The appellants assaulted the informant and others who reached the place of incident with farsa, spear and sword and inflicted injuries on their heads, legs, back and other parts of the body. The Appellants were charged under Section 302 and 324 IPC, alternatively under Sections 147, 302/149, 324/149, 329/149 IPC. There was a total of 21 accused apart from the two juveniles Ram Narayan and Kanhaiya Lal. 14 witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution. On a consideration of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the Trial Court held the accused guilty of committing offences under Section 147, 302/149 for committing murder of Babulal and under Sections 325/149, 324/149, 323/149 for voluntarily causing hurt to others. The accused were sentenced to life imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with 149 IPC, 3 years rigorous imprisonment under Section 325/149, 2 years rigorous imprisonment under section 324/149 and six months for each count under Section 323/149 IPC. The Trial Court observed that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the injured eye-witnesses are trivial and their evidence cannot be rejected on that ground. The High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the Appellants by holding that there was no error committed by the Trial Court. The discrepancies in the statements made by the witnesses in Court were held to be minor in nature on the basis of which the Appellants cannot be said to be not guilty. The attack made by all the accused on the deceased Babulal and the injured witnesses has been narrated by them in one voice, though with some minor variations. After the perusal of the facts and arguments by the learned counsels, the Hon’ble Court held, “In the instant case, the fatal injury was caused by a hard and blunt weapon on the left parietal bone. Therefore, the conviction of the Appellants under Section 302/149 is not justified. However, there is abundant evidence on record to show that the Appellants attacked the deceased and the injured witnesses with deadly weapons. Therefore, the Appellants are liable to be convicted under Section 326 read with 149 IPC. The conviction of the Appellants under Sections 325/149, 324/149, 323/149 is confirmed. We are informed that the Appellants have undergone a sentence of four and half years.
