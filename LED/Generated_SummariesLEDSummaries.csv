"Section 86(1)(f) vests a statutory jurisdiction with the State Electricity Commission to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration. therefore, the appointment of arbitrators by the commission overrides the appointment of arbitrators by the High Court. This judgment was passed in the case of Chief General Manager (IPC) M P Power Trading Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. Narmada Equipments Pvt. Ltd. [C.A.No.1051/2021] by a Bench consisting of Hon’ble Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Hon’ble Justice M R Shah, and Hon’ble Justice Sanjiv Khanna. The present appeal arose from a judgment passed by the MP High Court where it appointed an Arbitrator in the dispute between the parties, in an application filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. The MP Electricity Board entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in 1999 with the respondent and the latter was to establish a mini hydroelectric project on a built and operate basis. However, the PPA was terminated in 2001 by the Board. The respondent initially filed a writ petition challenging the termination of the PPA, wherein the High Court, declined to entertain the petition in view of an arbitration agreement or clause in the PPA. the respondent filed a review petition which was also dismissed by the High Court. the respondent, therefore, issued a notice to the board seeking to resolve the dispute by mutual discussion. Since the respondent did not receive a reply to the notice in 2011, the respondent issued another notice to the Board. The respondent stated that if the Board did not act upon the notice within 30 days of its receipt, it would approach the High Court under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act. having received no reply, the respondent approached the High Court. The appointed arbitrators refused to initiate the proceeding since their fees had not been paid. The respondents filed an AC under which the Single Judge held that remedies under Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Electricity Act and under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act are independent of each other, and it was open to the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 11(6). Therefore the Appellant appealed before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court observed that section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act, is a special provision that overrides the general provisions contained in Section 11 of the 1996 Act. Section 86(1)(f) vests a statutory jurisdiction with the State Electricity Commission to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration. Further Section 174 of the Electricity Act, provides an overriding effect to the 1996 Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the 2003 Act itself. The Supreme Court further held that if there is an inherent lack of jurisdiction, the plea can be taken at any stage and also in collateral proceedings. The Court reiterated a well-established principle that a decree passed by a court without subject matter jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon. Such a defect of jurisdiction cannot be cured even by the consent of the parties. Therefore the State Electricity Commission had jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator since Section 86(1)(f) refers to disputes only between licensees and generating companies. Thus, the order of the High Court appointing an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act is unsustainable. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the order of the High Court was set aside.",['The judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in the case of the Electricity Dispute between the two parties was passed by a High Court in a judgment passed by the High court in a judgement passed in a matter between the parties.

The counsel for the petitioner held that both the families were agnates. according to the FIR, no reason has been stated on why such an event took place, the accused has also filed a case against the informant Muffasil PS Case No. 115 of 2021 on the same day, as the informant along with his family teased and harassed one of the petitioners and when the family were involved and confronted the informant they were attacked, the deceased is the own uncle of the co-accused and the parties are neighbors. The allegations were falsely implicated because there was no injury report for the attack on the mother and regarding the sister, according to the injury report, only one lacerated wound above the left half upper lip 1” x 1/2” and no sign of bite was found by the doctor. All the petitioners are females and have no criminal antecedent they have been implicated with ulterior motive and the death of the father of the informant was caused by the co-accused and not the petitioners. The APP held that the petitioners were accused of assaulting the mother and biting the sister of the informant, counsel for the informant held that the father of the informant died due to the injuries resulting from the assault. However, it is not controverted that the assault on the deceased was done by the co-accused and not the petitioners and also there is no injury report for the attack on the mother of the informant. After considering the facts and circumstances of the case the Patna High Court held that “the allegations against the petitioners, who have been made accused along with their other male members, are not corroborated by the material brought before the police and as the petitioners are ladies without any criminal antecedent, the Court is inclined to allow their prayer for grant of pre-arrest bail.”","['The petitioners were accused of assaulting the informant.

This petition is in connection with Dinara PS Case No. 9 of 2020 dated 03.01.2020. It is the second attempt for bail by the petitioner which was rejected by the judgment passed Criminal Misc. No. 20913 of 2020. In the high court of Judicature at Patna, this judgement was given by honourable Mr Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah on the 25th of August 2021 in the case of Jabbar Miyan @ Jabbar Miya and others versus the state of Bihar, criminal miscellaneous No. 19491 of 2021. Mr Md. Mushtaque represented as the advocate for the petitioner, and Mr Ajay Kumar Jha represented the state of Bihar as the additional Public Prosecutor, the proceedings of the court were held via video conference. The following are the facts of the case, the petitioners were accused because he had kept the informant and two other girls in his house and did not allow them to go out. The petitioner runs a dance troupe and he attempted to commit immoral acts and human trafficking where he did not succeed and he had taken the informant’s signature on a blank paper after threatening them and told them the informant has been bought for Rs. 30,000. The counsel representing the petitioner held that according to the FIR the informant stated that she was held for 10 days and she was allowed to go out only by fulfilling the contract agreement which was dancing and singing at various functions and the counsel held that the FIR was filed few days after due to money dispute. The counsel provided a supplementary affidavit as evidence to prove the same. The counsel held that the allegations against the petitioners have been falsely implicated and the informant and other girls had taken the money in order to perform in the dance troupe however slater on the informants neither wanted to perform nor return the money and lodged this false case. The counsel submitted that according to the allegations there was no wrongful act and the girls were kept inside as they belonged from outside the state and they were taken care of properly and even after medical examination there was no wrong found out and the petitioner has been held in custody since the 4th of January 2020. Further, the counsel held that the entire family and their livelihood which they depend on has been damaged due to this false accusation and incarceration, therefore, the court is required to impose conditions to release the petitioner on bail. The additional public prosecutor held that the petitioners have been directly accused by the informants who are the girls that they were confined wrongfully and against their wish and did not allow them to leave and the petitioner also tried to commit human trafficking. The court held that after considering the facts and circumstances of the case the court held that taking into consideration that there is evidence to indicate that there was a professional relationship between the petitioner and the girls which may have gone sour and most importantly, actual physical abuse not being alleged and the allegation being only that the petitioner had tried to commit immoral act but could not succeed, the Court is inclined to grant bail to the petitioner. The court concluded that “the petitioner will be released on bail upon furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned SDJM, in PS Case No. 09 of 2020 subject to the conditions under section 438 (2) Cr.P.C.

"In matters concerning administrative appointments, the seniority of the transferee shall prevail as opposed to the direct recruits if the seniority predates the vacancy generated for the office of the latter. A bench comprising of Rajiv Sahai, J. and Amit Bansal J. observed in the matter of Yash Rattan v Union of India [W.P.(C) 3576/2021] that seniority shall not be claimed to a public office prior to induction into cadre. The petitioners herein were appointed as Inspectors in the Delhi Commissionerate of the respondents in the year 2016 under the direct recruit quota. The private respondents (who were the petitioners before the CAT) were also direct recruits recruited in the year 2011 in various zones outside Delhi. At their request, they were transferred to the Delhi Zone in the year 2014. The main ground of challenge in the OA No. 2955/2019 was that the petitioners who had joined the department after the joining of the private respondents cannot be placed above them in the seniority list. The CAT set aside the seniority list, subsequent to which the present writ petition has been filed. The counsel contending on behalf of the petitioners relied on the judgment of Union of India v N.R. Parmar ((2012) 13 SCC 340) and opined that the recruitment year would be the year of initiating the recruitment process against a vacancy year. The corresponding counsel pointed out that the judgment in N.R. Parmar stood prospectively overruled in K. Meghachandra Singh &amp;Ors. Vs. Nigam Siro &amp; Ors ((2020) 5 SCC 689). He further added that seniority position was not settled when the K. Meghachandra Singh judgment was delivered, as the private respondents had filed objections against the seniority list of 15th March, 2018 and further had challenged the same before the CAT before the K. Meghachandra Singh judgment was delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Therefore, it is wrong to state that the seniority position was settled. The Court after a careful reading of the K. Meghachandra judgment followed through that seniority of direct recruits had to be fixed from the date of appointment and not from the date of initiation of the recruitment process, and any person aspiring to a vacant post does not have any vested right to it. The court further observed that “In service jurisprudence, seniority cannot be claimed from the date when the incumbent is yet to be borne in the cadre and therefore, norms on assessment of inter se seniority, suggested in N.R. Parmar case was disapproved; decision in N.R. Parmar case is overruled, however, the decision will not affect the inter se seniority already based on N.R. Parmar case and the same is protected. Decision will apply prospectively.”","['The judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Delhi High Court held that if a person is appointed to a position in a department, he or she cannot be appointed to the position of an officer. The judgment was passed by the High Court of Delhi in the case of the Delhi Commissionerate. The High Court had held that the seniority of the officers was not a matter of principle. It was stated in the judgment that the officers were appointed to positions in the department. The judgement was passed on the basis of the principle of principle that the officer can be appointed by the Commissioner of Police. It is stated that if an officer is appointed by an officer, he/she cannot be promoted to the post of a seniority officer.']"
"The facts and information of the suspected offences are not an encyclopedia that is to reveal all the facts and details. It doesn’t need an argument, and cannot be ruled out as a result, that the FIR is just an informant’s note on a recognizable offence. This auspicious judgment was passed by The High Court of Bombay in the Matter of Smt. Jayshri W/o Ratan Uchit vs The State of Maharashtra and others. [922 CRIMINAL APPLICATION NO. 1606 OF 2019] by Honorable Justice R.V. Ghuge &amp; Justice B. U. Debadwar. The facts of the case are that Ratan Uchit had been mentally and physically fit, committed suicide within just four months and six days, after marriage with the applicant, and two suicide notes, which the deceased Ratan Uchit had left behind, contended that the applicant was often engaged in quarrels with him. He was then fed up and committed suicide. Learned counsel for the applicant vehemently argued that FIR sought to be quashed has been registered for the offence of abetment to commit suicide punishable under section 306 of the I.P.C, and allegation about abetment made in the FIR is very much vague in nature. There are no charges are made under the FIR which suggests that, in accordance with that instigation, the applicant deliberately prompted her husband Ratan Uchit to commit suicide. Learned counsel for the respondents argued that Ratan Uchit had committed suicide only after four months and six days of the marriage performed with the applicant. She is a quarrelsome woman, she had mentally harassed her husband to a great extent by picking up quarrels with him frequently for petty reasons. The court relied on the case of “C.B.I. vs. Tapan Kumar Singh; the Honourable Supreme Court has held in paragraph 22 that “The law does not require the mentioning of all the ingredients of the offence in the FIR. It is only after completion of the investigation that it may be possible to say whether any offence is made out on the basis of the evidence collected by the investigating agency. It is observed that an FIR is not an encyclopedia that must disclose all the facts and details relating to the offence alleged to have been committed. It requires no debate that an FIR is merely a report by the informant about the commission of a cognizable offence and it cannot be ruled out that minute details may not be mentioned.” ","['The offence of murder is punishable under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code.

"In the present strained circumstances, it is not in the interest of justice that a person be denied the opportunity to file an application for restoration of the case and the same must be treated on urgent basis by the authorities. The aforesaid has been established by the Delhi High Court in the case of Ajay Garg v. Delhi Development Authority [W.P.(C) 6033/2021 &amp; C.M APPLs. 19090-091/2021] which was decided by a single judge bench comprising Justice C. Hari Shankar on 28th June 2021.

Said suit was dismissed by the learned Senior Civil Judge, vide order dated 8th April, 2021, under Order XVII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Thereafter, the petitioner moved an application for restoration of the suit. Counsel for petitioner submitted that, as the presiding officer of the court which was dealing with the petitioner’s suit is not sitting, the application for restoration has not been listed. Given the present scenario, in which the trial courts are functioning only on a virtual and restricted mode, he submits that despite his client’s best efforts, it has not been possible to have the restoration application listed before the Court. Learned Standing Counsel for the DDA, submits that the property of the petitioner has already been demolished, though the said assertion is disputed by counsel for petitioner on instructions.","['The petitioner’s application for restoration of SCJ 82888 2016 was filed before the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi.

"On deciding a case regarding the contradiction of rules framed by the new and old state, the Supreme court decided that the state under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution empowered them to prescribe conditions, rules for employment as deemed appropriate apart from the already present enactments. This judgment was passed in the case of Suman Devi &amp; ors. vs. State of Uttarakhand and Ors. [C.A.No.554-557/2021], by a Single Bench consisting of Hon’ble Justice Ajay Mohan Goel. According to the facts of this case, the appellants were registered as Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM) and complained that the Uttarakhand High Court’s judgment regarding their ineligibility for appointment to the cadre of Family Health Worker (FHW), ANM, and Health Supervisor (HS) was erroneous. The erstwhile United Provinces enacted a law, the UP Law. The object of the UP Law was to provide for the registration of the nursing profession and was later amended, where the definition of ANM was inserted. The Indian Nursing Council (INC) was brought into force with the objective to set up a central council (Council) for a uniform standards of training. Section 11  of the INC Act, stated that notwithstanding other laws, any recognized qualification was to be sufficient qualification for enrolment in any State register. Rule 5 of UP framed the Uttar Pradesh Department of Medical Health and Family Welfare Health Worker and Health Supervisor (Male and Female) Service Rules, 1997 stated that direct recruitment through the Public Service Commission of Health Worker (Male) would be from male candidates who successfully completed the 1-year basic health worker training course conducted by the departmental divisional training centers of the state. For females, the rule 5(2) provided that they needed 1 and a half years of training conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council, Lucknow. Such candidates also had to be duly registered under the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council, Lucknow. However, it was apparently amended in 1998. The State of Uttarakhand was formed on re-organization of the State of U.P and adopted the laws of composite U.P. Thus, the 1997 Rules providing for recruitment of male and female Health Worker with the 1998 amendments, continued to remain in force in Uttarakhand. In 2007 the INC provided that the basic qualification for the Nursing Auxiliary program was the Secondary School Certificate Examination. In 2016 it was again amended to intermediate or equivalent (10+2 from a recognized board) in the science stream. Writ petitions were filed before the Uttarakhand High Court, questioning the advertisement and seeking a direction that the recruitment, to the extent it was contrary to the rules. After hearing both the parties, it was observed by the Supreme Court that there was no merit in the contention that the requirement of an intermediate in science stream did not exist since the adaptation order under the Reorganization Act omitted the rules framed by the erstwhile state of UP. The supreme court observed that the Reorganization Act provided for laws of the erstwhile state of UP to remain operative in Uttarakhand and section 87 had the effect of obliging the state and the courts to thereafter enforce the existing laws, to the extent they were modified within a period of 2 years from the date of commencement of the Reorganization Act. in other words the power to adapt only meant such laws which required some modifications or adaptations, could be so modified or adapted within the period defined, i.e., 2 years. The supreme court held that the state as a public employer s empowered by virtue of the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, to frame appropriate rules. These rules can prescribe conditions of service for various posts, classes of posts, and services under the state. The fact that INC Act allowed the council to prescribe conditions for uniformity is in no way undermining the authority of the state to prescribe other conditions. The court, therefore, concluded that it perceived no conflict between the provisions of the INC Act and the recruitment rules which were in force in the state of Uttarakhand from the time of its creation in 2000, till 2016 when the rules were changed after the advertisement in question for the recruitments was issued.","['The application was made under Section 87 of the Uttarakhand Act, 1997, which was passed by the State High Court in 1998.

"In the case of Parneet Kaur Vs State of Punjab and others [Criminal Writ Petition No.777 of 2019] High Court of Punjab and Haryana directed the respondent- State to pay a compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh) each to detenues Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur. The complainant informed the police about theft in her house. While the police reached the spot, it came across to them that husband of Harwinder Kaur and the father of the petitioner was charged in a case regarding murder. The husband Palwinder Singh was evading his arrest. While the police were inspecting the spot, few unknown men and women came there and started abusing and beating Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur. The police under the protection of female police officers tried to rescue Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur from the house, upon which the mob attacked them with sticks and stones with the intention to kill both the women. Failing in all the efforts, the Duty Magistrate ordered Lathi Charge on the crowd in order to save the lives of Harwinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur. The mob caused damage to the government and private vehicles as well. After lot of struggle both women were rescued from the spot. Subsequently, the present criminal writ petition was filed for issuance of writ in the nature of habeas corpus to set detenues, Harvinder Kaur and her daughter Rupinder Kaur free and to produce them before this Court after conducting their medical examination from Civil Surgeon or any other competent authority, as the detenues were claimed to have been illegally detained by respondents. It was contended by the respondent that it was in good faith and in order to protect their lives from angry mob, they (the alleged detenues) had been permitted to stay back in Police Station City Rupnagar until the situation got normalized.

"Section 73 of the railway’s act, 1989 provides a statutory right to the railway administration to reweigh the consignment – Jharkhand High Court The present appeal under Section 23 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 against the judgment passed by railway claims tribunal to direct the appellant to refund Rs. 3,71,328/- to the respondents. The appeal is filed against the judgment and is heard and allowed by a single judge bench of HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE GAUTAM KUMAR CHOUDHARY in the case of Union of India versus M/s. Muva Industries Ltd and Ors. (M.A. No. 30 of 2011) The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that by the order number RCT/DLI/Judl.Policy/2002-2003 of railway claims tribunal,13/15 Moldova daily. the pecuniary jurisdiction of the concerned single bench is restricted to ₹ 2 lakhs (Rupees Two Lakhs), except in untoward and train accident cases, and according to the proviso to Section 4(4) of the Railways Claims Criminal Act 1987, the single-member should have referred/transferred the matter to a bench of two members to a division bench as the matter demands and apart from the jurisdiction issue raised it was also submitted that there is provision to re-weigh and there was nothing wrong on the part of the Railway authorities to have a reweighed the consignment and during rebooking of the consignment the punitive charges were paid by the respondent without any objection and once the excess weight is accepted then the plea against overloading and consequent punitive charges cannot be raised. It was further argued that in LPA No. 493 of 2010, the Hon’ble Court was pleased to permit the appellant to withdraw the appeal and the writ and therefore the order passed by Hon’ble. the single Judge in the writ petition does not bar the appellant from preferring the instant appeal. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submits that the Hon’ble single Bench in W.P.(C) No. 274 of 2010 has already confirmed the order of the tribunal and dismissed the writ. And as far the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction is concerned it is apparent from the order passed in LPA No. 493 of 2010 and the earlier order passed by Hon’ble single Judge in W.P.(C) No. 274 of 2010 has not been interfered with and therefore cannot be reopened in this appeal. The respondent also submits that Section 21(2) of the CPC and that objection as to the competence of a Court regarding the pecuniary limits of its jurisdiction cannot be allowed in appeal or revision unless the objection was taken in the Court of the first instance at the earliest opportunity. The court finds merit in the appeal and the matters into consideration that whether the Railways had the right to reweigh the consignment and whether the necessary procedure was followed. Section 78 of the Railways Act 1989 lays down specific power to reweigh the consignment and relies on the case of Union of India v. Shree Shiv Sai Steel Industries, 2019 SCC OnLine Gau 5715 : (2020) 1 Gau LR 426 : (2019) 203 AIC (Sum 20) 9 at page 428 and on the case of Jagjit Cotton Textile Mills v. Chief Commercial Supdt., N.R., (1998) 5 SCC 126 at page 147 and finds and main ground which the application for refund has been allowed by the learned Tribunal is that none of the representatives were present at the time when the consignment was being reweighed. Section 73 of the railway’s act specifically provides that the railway administration may reweigh the consignment and recalculate the freight and other charges before the delivery of the goods and makes it a statutory right of railway administration to consider all sorts of malpractices and under the impugned circumstances of the case the present appeal is allowed and the impugned order was set aside.","['It is held that if the matter is brought before the High Court of Jharkhand, it is the right of the appellant to withdraw the appeal and the writ petition.

"It is well settled law that this Court does not normally reappreciate the evidence unless the assessment of the High Court is vitiated by an error of law or procedure or is based on error of record, misreading of evidence or is inconsistent with the evidence. This Court does not enter into credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court through the learned bench led by Justice L.

On a consideration of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the Trial Court held the accused guilty of committing offences under Section 147, 302/149 for committing murder of Babulal and under Sections 325/149, 324/149, 323/149 for voluntarily causing hurt to others. The accused were sentenced to life imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with 149 IPC, 3 years rigorous imprisonment under Section 325/149, 2 years rigorous imprisonment under section 324/149 and six months for each count under Section 323/149 IPC. The Trial Court observed that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the injured eye-witnesses are trivial and their evidence cannot be rejected on that ground. The High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the Appellants by holding that there was no error committed by the Trial Court. The discrepancies in the statements made by the witnesses in Court were held to be minor in nature on the basis of which the Appellants cannot be said to be not guilty. The attack made by all the accused on the deceased Babulal and the injured witnesses has been narrated by them in one voice, though with some minor variations. After the perusal of the facts and arguments by the learned counsels, the Hon’ble Court held, “In the instant case, the fatal injury was caused by a hard and blunt weapon on the left parietal bone. Therefore, the conviction of the Appellants under Section 302/149 is not justified. However, there is abundant evidence on record to show that the Appellants attacked the deceased and the injured witnesses with deadly weapons. Therefore, the Appellants are liable to be convicted under Section 326 read with 149 IPC. The conviction of the Appellants under Sections 325/149, 324/149, 323/149 is confirmed. We are informed that the Appellants have undergone a sentence of four and half years. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that a sentence of seven years under Section 326/149 would meet the ends of justice. While upholding the judgment of the High Court regarding the conviction and sentence of the Appellants, we convert the conviction and sentence from life imprisonment to seven years. The Appeals are partly allowed.”",['The High Court held that the evidence of the witnesses was not sufficient to justify the conviction of the Appellants under Section 149 IPC. It was held that there was a contradiction between the testimony of the eyewitnesses and the evidence given by the High Court. The witnesses were not held to be witnesses and the witnesses were held to have been witnesses. The High Court had held that they were not guilty of murder and that they had been acquitted of murder under Section 148 IPC and Section 149']

JUSTICE S. KUMAR in the case of National Insuranc Co Ltd Vs. The State of Bihar (Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.42 of 2022) Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner has requested for the issuance of a writ of certiorari to overturn an appellate order dated 13.11.2021 passed by the respondent and issued via memo in Appeal Case, in which the petitioner’s appeal against the respondent’s order dated 24.02.2021 was dismissed without consideration of the factual and legal issues contended and raised by the petitioner in appeal. The petitioner has asked for the issuance of a writ in the nature of certiorari to quashing the respondent’s order dated 24.02.2021 passed under Section 73 of the Bihar Goods And Services Tax Act, 2017 read with the Central Goods And Services Tax Act, 2017, as well as a holding and declaration that the impugned order dated 24.02.2021 passed by the respondent is an erroneous exercise of jurisdiction by the respond. During the pendency of the instant writ application or thereafter jurisdiction by the respondent, the petitioner has requested the issuance of a writ or order or direction restraining the respondents from taking any coercive action against the petitioner in terms of section 79 of the Bihar Act 2017 read with the Central Act, 2017 for recovery of the amount in demand in terms of the impugned order of assessment dated 24.02.2021 passed by the respondent during the pendency. Court noticed that, pursuant to the impugned order dated 13.11.2021 issued by the Respondent, namely the Additional Commissioner of State Taxes (Appeal), Central Division, Patna in Appeal Case, the petitioner’s appeal against the order dated 24.02.2021 issued by the Respondent, namely the Assistant Commissioner of State Taxes, Patliputra Circle, Patna, has been dismissed, allegedly without appreciating the factual and legal. The Revenue’s learned counsel says he has no objection to the case being remanded to the Assessing Authority to be decided again. In addition, the matter will be decided on its merits. Furthermore, no coercive measures against the petitioner may be done while the case is pending. The parties’ learned counsel, after reviewing the record, are of the considered opinion that, despite the statutory remedy, this Court is not prevented from interfering if, ex facie, and obtain the opinion that the order is defective in law as (a) it is a violation of natural justice norms, such as the right to a fair hearing. The petitioner was not given enough time to plead his case; and (b) the order, which was issued ex parte, does not identify any sufficient grounds, even if decipherable from the record, as to how the officer arrived at the sum owing and payable by the assessee. The order, which was issued ex parte and in breach of natural justice principles, has civil ramifications. As a result, we dismiss the present writ petition on this single ground, quashing and setting aside the impugned order dated 13.11.2021 issued by the Respondent, Additional Commissioner of State Taxes (Appeal), Central Division, Patna in Appeal Case, as well as the order dated 24.02.2021 issued by the Respondent, namely the Assistant Commissioner of State Taxes, Patliputra Circle, Patna. The petitioner’s declaration that 10% of the total money is already deposited, which is a condition precedent to hearing the appeal, is correct. However, if the sum is not deposited for whatever reason(s), it must be done before the next date, and the court must order the de-freezing/de-attachment of the writ-bank petitioner’s account(s), if attached in reference to the proceedings, to be done immediately.

"Section 197 of the CrPC seeks to protect an officer from unnecessary harassment, who is accused of an offence committed while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties and, thus, prohibits the court from taking cognisance of such offence except with the previous sanction of the competent authority. Public servants have been treated as a special category in order to protect them from malicious or vexatious prosecution. The indulgence of the officers in cheating, fabrication of records or misappropriation cannot be said to be in discharge of their official duty. The aforesaid has been held by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Indra Devi v. State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr [SLP (Crl) No. 1605 of 2018] which was decided by the single judge bench comprising Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul on 23July 2021. The facts of the case are as follows. It was alleged that the appellant and her husband Bhanwar Lal purchased two plots in Khasra. Out of these two plots, one plot was sold to one Megharam while another plot was sold to one Chetan Choudhary. In the plot purchased in the name of her husband, a residential house and shops are stated to have been made. Megharam is alleged to have tampered with and fabricated the agreement with the intention to defraud. This was allegedly done in collusion with the then executive officer of the Municipality, one Surender Kumar Mathur and “the concerned clerk and others”, by enlarging the dimensions of the plot which have been sold to him with the intention to grab the land and house occupied by the complainant and her husband. In pursuance of the investigation, a chargesheet was filed and charges were framed Respondent No.2 moved an application under Section 197 of the CrPC before the trial court stating that he was a public servant and what he did in respect of allotment of lease, that was executed in favour of Megharam, was done during the course of his official duty and thus he was entitled to protection under the aforementioned provision. This application was dismissed by the trial court.

"Can a plaintiff be entitled to the suit claim, and also can a suit be barred by limitation? Basically, the appellant files a complaint against the respondent seeking to get back his damaged 139 empty barrels or in alternative pay of  RS 19460/-  in this case, this was held in the judgement passed by a single bench judge comprising HON’BLE SRI JUSTICE  M. VENKATA RAMAN, in the matter  SECOND APPEAL No. 684 of 2000, State of Andhra Pradesh, dealt with an issue mentioned above. In this case, the appellant was appointed as an agent by the respondent itself by his letter dated 04.12.1981. Basically, the agent work was to distribute the palomino oil on behalf of the respondent covering Tenali and Emani Taluqs, Guntur District. When a shortage of 735 Kgs, of palomino oil, was found with 139 barrels containing oil out of 450. The appellant also claimed that the sub-agent Sir CH.V.S.Chalapathi Roa as sub-agent in his place and that he had over the aforesaid 139 barrels of oil to Sir Chalapathi Roa. Appellant also claimed that he brings the owner of 139 barrels which he had purchased at Hyderabad for 140/- each. The respondent then resisted the claim by denying the relationship between him and the appellant as principal and agent respectively. Respondent mentioned that he had appointed agents by the aforestated corporation for proper distribution of oil to various fair price shop dealers.   On the pleading, the trial court settled the following issues for trial;- To establish a certain fact, the appellant relied on EX.A1 a letter dated 04.12.1981 of the respondent. it was mentioned has an ‘Appointment letter’. But the respondent stated that it was an authorisation letter and this contention was accepted by the learned appellate Judge contra to the findings of the learned trial judge that it was an out and out Appointment letter. As mentioned above the appellant being an agent of the respondent at Tenali had no concern to A.P. State Civil Supplies Corporation. It was also admitted and proved fact, so in such a situation there was so need for the Civil Supplies Corporation, to direct the respondent to return 139 empty barrels to the appellant, as seen from EX.A2. Also, the EX.B1 letter which was on the behalf of the respondent dated 26.07.1985 was also rejected. In the end, the appellant failed to establish the suit transaction against the respondent and de’hors EX.A2, there is no other material for the appellant except his oral evidence. so the appellant came up with a specific plea of contract which stood out to be hopelessly barred by the time.

"“One of the categories which attracts more stringent punishment is the rape on a woman who is pregnant” Om Prakash @ Chhotey who was related to the parents of the informant, met then in the Court premises. Jaipal (PW-2) brother of Ram Saran was also there along with the informant and she was talking to him about bail of her husband. After sometime, accused Om Prakash sent PW-2 to find out whether the challan had come or not. Then at about 3.00 p.m. accused overpowered the informant and he started raping her in the veranda of Zila Parishad near the Court. When the informant raised alarm, PW-2 and one Ram Lal came there and they assaulted Om Prakash who was raping her and they apprehended him and the accused was taken to the police station.The informant gave oral information and then Chik number 126 Exhibit A-1 was recorded and the entry was made in the general diary and the case was registered. Internal examination of the body of the informant was done by Dr. Purnima Srivastava (PW-3) and the medical report is Exhibit A-2 and the supplementary report is Exhibit A-3. The medical examination of the accused was done by Dr. P.K. Gangwar (PW-4) and the report is Exhibit A-4.ISSUE BEFORE THE COURT:Whether evidence establishes knowledge of the accused?Whether the judgement given by trial and High court was applicable? RATIO OF THE COURT:The court heard the learned counsels and referred to the judgement of trial and high court that the statement of accused Om Prakash was recorded under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. The accused alleged that he was implicated due to the enmity. It was stated by him that he had come from the village along with the brother of the victim and other persons for taking steps. He even made some attempts in the police station in the night. He had taken some money for the purpose. When the challan came, they got down at Bilgram Chungi and then a quarrel took place amongst the accused, PW-2 and father of the victim on the question of refund of the money.  They assaulted him and he was implicated in the criminal case.The court held that the applicability of Section 376(2)(e) is concerned, it is submitted that the doctor has clearly stated that the victim was six months pregnant, and it could be known from the external appearance. The Trial Court had rightly observed that the accused must have known the victim was pregnant and there is full possibility in that regard.  Though the High Court has not dealt with this aspect, it has clearly noted that the accused was in a position to dominate the will of the victim. It is settled law that the victim of sexual assault is not treated as accomplice and as such, her evidence does not require corroboration from any other evidence including the evidence of a doctor. In a given case even if the doctor who examined the victim does not find sign of rape, it is no ground to disbelieve the sole testimony of the prosecutrix. In normal course a victim of sexual assault does not like to disclose such offence even before her family members much less before public or before the police. The Indian women has tendency to conceal such offence because it involves her prestige as well as prestige of her family.Only in few cases, the victim girl or the family members has courage to go before the police station and lodge a case. In the instant case the suggestion given on behalf of the defence that the victim has falsely implicated the accused does not appeal to reasoning. There was no apparent reason for a married woman to falsely implicate the accused after scatting her own prestige and honour.The court observed that crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while celebrating women’s rights in all spheres, show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. The court noticed that a rapist not only violates the victim’s privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault — it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female.The Court, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepencies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars.The court observed that stringent punishment is the rape on a woman who is pregnant.  In such cases where commission of rape is established for operation of Section 376(2)(e) the prosecution has to further establish that accused knew the victim to be pregnant. In the instant case there was no such evidence led. The Trial Court came to the conclusion that there was “full possibility” of the accused knowing it. There is a gulf of difference between possibility and certainty. While considering the case covered by Section 376(2)(e) what is needed to be seen is whether evidence establishes knowledge of the accused. Mere possibility of knowledge is not sufficient.  When a case relates to one where because of the serious nature of the offence, as statutorily prescribed, more stringent sentence is provided, it must be established and not a possibility is to be inferred.  The language of Section 376(2)(e) is clear. It requires prosecution to establish that the accused knew her to be pregnant.  This is clear from the use of the expression “knowing her to be pregnant”.  This is conceptually different that there is a possibility of his knowledge or that probably he knew it.  DECISION HELD BY COURT:The court held that positive evidence has to be adduced by the prosecution about the knowledge. In the absence of any material brought on record to show that the accused knew the victim to be pregnant Section 376(2)(e) IPC cannot be pressed into service.  To that extent the judgment of the Courts below are unsustainable. The court said minimum sentence prescribed under Section 376(1) IPC is clearly applicable.With the modification of sentence by reduction from 10 years to 7 years, the appeal is dismissed.         ",['The offence of rape is punishable under Section 376(2)(e) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and it is the responsibility of the State to ensure that the accused is held responsible for the rape of a minor. The offence of raping a minor is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of ten years. The trial court has held that the offence is committed by a minor and that it is a serious offence. The accused is liable to be held responsible if the accused commits the offence. It is the offence of sexual assault and rape']

"In the case of Rajesh Dhiman v. State of Himachal Pradesh (CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1032 of 2013), the SC had held that had clarified  the   expression of  “reasonable   doubt”   is   a   well-­defined connotation.  It refers to the degree of certainty required of a court before it can make a legally valid determination of the guilt of an accused. Reasonable doubt does not mean that proof be so clear that no possibility of error exists. The facts of this case initiating both the appeals are common. On 09.01.2002, at about 1.00 P.M., a police team led by ASI Purushottam Dutt (PW8) and also comprising Constable Sunder Singh (PW1), Constable Bhup Singh (PW2) and Constable Bhopal Singh   (PW7)   were   checking traffic at   Shamshar when a motorcycle without a number plate was spotted. Gulshan Rana (appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1126 of 2019) was driving the vehicle and Rajesh Dhiman (appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1032 of 2013) was seated on the pillion with a backpack slung over his shoulders. They were signaled to stop and documents of the motorcycle were demanded. Meanwhile, another vehicle was halted and its occupants Karam Chand (PW3) and Shiv Ram were included in the search. An attempt was made to associate local residents to witness the subsequent proceedings,   but none agreed. Subsequently, the appellants were given the option to be searched in the presence of a Magistrate or Gazetted Officer but they consented to be searched by the police on the spot itself. The police then discovered polythene bags containing charas from the backpack carried by Rajesh Dhiman. The polythene bags were weighed and found to be 3kg 100gms. After separating some samples, the charas was duly sealed and handed over to Karam Chand (PW3) who later deposited it at the police station. After completion of the personal search of the appellants,  they were formally arrested. The prosecution examined nine witnesses to support their case of chance recovery, which included eight police officials and one independent witness, Karam Chand (PW3). Whereas the police witnesses strongly corroborated each other’s testimony, PW3 was declared hostile for he claimed not to have witnessed the seizure of the narcotics. The spot map, arrest memo, search memos, consent memo, seizure memo, rukka seals, chemical analysis report and samples of  charas  were also adduced as evidence. In response, both appellants asserted their innocence. The learned   Special   Judge   through judgment   dated 28.12.2002 acquitted the appellants holding that charges under the NDPS Act had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial Court viewed that the witnesses on the spot had either not been examined or turned hostile. The question of law, in this case, initiate with the Criminal Appeals which had been preferred against a common judgment of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh dated 28.08.2012, by which the appellants’ acquittal under Section 20 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (“NDPS Act”) was reversed and a sentence of ten years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs 1,00,000 each was awarded. The judges, in this case, had held “ We, therefore, see no reason to draw any adverse inference against PW8 himself investigating his complaint. The appellants’ claim of bias stems from the purported delays, non­compliance of statutory   mandates   and   non­examination   of   independent witness. In effect, the appellants are seeking to circuitously use the very same arguments which have individually been held by the High Court to be factually incorrect or legally irrelevant. Although in some cases, certain actions (or lack thereof) by the Investigating Officer might indicate bias; but mere deficiencies in investigation or chinks in the prosecution case can’t be the sole basis for concluding bias. The appellants have at no stage claimed that there existed any enmity or other motive for the police to falsely implicate them and let the real culprits walk free. Further, such a huge quantity of  charas could not have been planted against the appellants by the police on its own.” “At the outset, we may clarify that the observations relied upon by the appellants, are not findings, conclusion or resolution by this Court in Mukesh Singh (supra). Instead, a perusal of the judgment shows that it was a contention put forth by one of the parties ­ which the Bench eventually disagreed with. Further, not only the alternative version projected by the appellants is vague and improbable, but it escapes our comprehension how non investigation of a defence theory disclosed only at an advanced stage of trial, could indicate bias on part of the police.”  “The contention of the appellants that they are entitled to be acquitted on the ground of there being two varying versions of the same incident does not carry any weight. We may firstly clarify that the expression   “reasonable doubt”   is a   well­defined connotation. It refers to the degree of certainty required of a court before it can make a legally valid determination of the guilt of an accused. These  words  are  inbuilt  measures  to  ensure  that innocence is to be presumed unless the court finds no reasonable doubt of the guilt of the person charged. Reasonable doubt does not mean that proof be so clear that no possibility of error exists. In other words, the evidence must only be so conclusive that all reasonable doubts are removed from the mind of an ordinary person.” “Reliance can also not be placed on Karam Chand’s (PW3) testimony by the appellants. First, his statement that he was told by the police that there was a third person on the spot is hearsay and inadmissible in view of Section 60 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Second, his credibility had effectively been impeached by the prosecutor during the trial. PW3 denies in his examination­in chief being on the spot or a party to any proceeding, but later he makes a poor attempt to contradict the prosecution story.” “Third,  given that PW3 himself claims to not being present at the time of the incident, his statement can at best be construed to mean that no charas was recovered in front of him, and not that no charas was recovered from the appellants at all.” “As correctly appreciated by the High Court in detail, non examination of independent witnesses would not ipso facto entitle one to seek acquittal. Though a heighted standard of care is imposed on the court in such instances but there is nothing to suggest that the High Court was not cognizant of this duty. Rather, the consequence of upholding the trial Court’s reasoning would amount to compulsory examination of each and every witness attached to the formation of a document. Not only is the imposition of such a standard of proof unsupported by statute but it is also unreasonably onerous in our opinion. The High Court has rightly relied upon the testimonies of the government officials having found them to be impeccable after detailed re appreciation of the entire evidence. We see no reason to disagree with such finding(s).” “There is no gainsaid that High Courts are well within their power to reverse an acquittal and award an appropriate sentence; though   they   cautiously   exercise   such   powers   in   practice. Illustratively, a few permissible reasons which would necessitate such interference by the High Court include patent errors of law, grave miscarriage of justice, or perverse findings of fact. Here, the trial Court appreciated facts in a mechanical manner and dismissed the prosecution case based on a mis interpretation of law, particularly qua satisfying the burden of proof. Hence, there were more than enough reasons for the High Court to interfere with the acquittal and arrive at a different finding.” “The appellants’ claim that the High Court erred in not considering non­compliance with Section 50 of the NDPS Act at the stage of appeal,   is also premised upon a   mistaken understanding of the law.”","['The offence of murder is punishable under Section 313 CrPC. The offence is punishable by imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1,000.

Writ petitions have been filed challenging the interim order dated 27th August 2021 passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi [AFT]. Petitioners also seek a direction to the Respondents not to release the Petitioners from service on 12th September 2021. counsel for the petitioners states that the AFT has fixed the next date of hearing on 27th September 2021 and if stay on release is not granted by this Court, the petitioners will be released from service on 12th September 2021. Counsel for the petitioners emphasises that no women officer, whose ACRs were only taken into account by the Special Selection Board No.5, has secured less than 60% marks. He further emphasises that fifteen women officers could not secure 60% marks due to inefficient and defective UAC appraisal System and contends that all UAC affected women officers being in highly disadvantageous positions are a distinct class. Learned counsel for the petitioners also submits that the action of the respondents is violative of the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Lt. Col. Nitisha &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. dated 25th March 2021, wherein it has been held as under:- QAP: Overall performance of the officer is evaluated by taking the average figurative assessment of all reporting officers other than FTO and HTO. The average will be worked out for each year as well as for the entire period of officers service. The latter QAP will be converted into a proportion of 75 marks.” (emphasis supplied). So the learned counsel for the respondents submits that Section 30 of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007 mandates that no appeal lies against an interlocutory order of the Tribunal. They also submit that the grounds urged in the present writ petitions do not warrant the issuance of a writ of certiorari. Moreover, despite the shortcomings in the UAC Appraisal System being pointed out by some of the petitioners in the case of Lt. Col. Nitisha (supra), the Supreme Court did not quash the same or direct that it shall not be taken into account while deciding the overall percentage of the candidates for permanent commission. This Court cannot lose sight of the fact that many short service commission officers may have been selected to a permanent commission on WP(C) 9633/2021 &amp; connected Page 5 of 5 the basis of the marks obtained by them in the UAC appraisal system. Further, if the UAC appraisal system is to be disregarded for petitioners for the period 1999-2005, then it is not understood as to what marking system is to replace it in the interregnum The court perused the facts and argument’s presented, it thought that –“ the opinion that paragraph 93 (v) referred to in the judgment Lt. Col. Nitisha (supra) offers no assistance to the petitioners as that is not one of the directions given by the Apex Court. This Court is also in agreement with the AFT and the learned predecessor Division Bench in WG CDR Nidhi Badhani Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors., W.P.(C) No.5871/2021 wherein it has been observed that if by an interim order an employee is allowed to continue in service and then if the writ petition is ultimately dismissed, it would tantamount to usurpation of public office without any right to the same. However, this Court does not doubt that the AFT shall try to dispose of the original applications filed by the petitioners as expeditiously as possible. Accordingly, the present writ petitions along with pending applications are dismissed .” Dated on 8th September 2021.",['The High Court of Delhi has held that the High Court has held in its judgment that the Chief Justice of India has been given the power to appoint a bench of the Supreme Court of India.

"It was noted that the appellant sought reasons for default of brokers. On perusal of the query, it appears that the same is in the nature of seeking clarification/opinion from the respondent. It is understood that the respondent is not supposed to create information; or to interpret information; or to furnish clarification to the appellant under the ambit of the RTI Act. It was found that the said query cannot be construed as seeking ‘information’ as defined under section 2 (f) of the RTI Act. In this context, reference is made to the matter of Vineet Pandey vs. CPIO, United India Insurance Company Limited (Judgment dated January 21, 2021), wherein similar observations were made by the Hon’ble CIC. Further, in the matter of Shri Shantaram Walavalkar vs. CPIO, SEBI (Decision dated January 17, 2013), it was noted that the Hon’ble CIC held: “… we would also like to observe that, under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the citizen has the responsibility to specify the exact information he wants; he is not supposed to seek any opinion or comments or clarifications or interpretations from the CPIO…”. In view of the said observations, the respondent did not have an obligation to provide such clarification/opinion under the RTI Act. On consideration of queries 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Mr Baiwar did not find any reason to disbelieve the observation that the requested information is not available with SEBI as the same is not maintained by SEBI in normal course of regulation of securities market. In this context, it was noted that the Hon’ble CIC did not find any need to intervene in the matter of Mrigesh Manubhai Thakkar vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Order dated December 28, 2016) while observing that “10.…… the respondents can provide only that information which is existing and available with them and the RTI Act does not mandate it for the respondent authority to create information if it is not collected and collated in the normal course of their duties.  The Commission, therefore, does not find any need to intervene in the matter. The appeal is disposed of.” In view of these observations, it was found that the information sought by the appellant was not available with SEBI and therefore, the respondent cannot be obliged to provide such non– available information.","['The Hon’ble CIC in the matter of Shri Subhash Chandra Agrawal Delhi vs. CBSE New Delhi, was held that the information sought by the appellant was not available with the Commissioner of Securities and Exchange Board of India.

"The Appellant as Plaintiff filed a Suit for Partition, Declaration, Recovery of Possession, and other Consequential Reliefs. The Learned District Court dismissed the case and the aggrieved appellant moved to High Court. After considering the facts and decision of the District Court, the High Court also dismissed the case. The Hon’ble High Court of Sikkim before Mrs. Justice Meenakshi Madan Rai held such in the matter of Ram Naresh Giri vs. Krishnawati Devi &amp; Ors.[ RFA No.02 of 2019]. The facts of that case were the aggrieved party moved to the High Court after his suit was dismissed by the learned District Judge, Special Division-I, Sikkim at Gangtok. The Appellant’s father had three sons and the appellant was the second son. The husband of Respondent No.1 who is the eldest son is untraceable since 1996. Respondents No. 2 &amp; 3 are the children of Respondent No. 1. Respondent No. 4 was the third son and suffered mental illness from 2000 to 2005. Appellant constructed a 4 storey RCC building on the plot which was allotted to his father by Sikkim Government in 1998. All the finance was done by the appellant himself. The dispute is between the inequitable distribution of the first floor where Respondent No. 2 and 3 have 2 shops. Appellant wasn’t given a portion despite having one-third share in it. The alternate was to compensate him monetarily for his investments in the property. The Learned Trial Court contended,” Issues No.3 and 4 were erroneously concluded observing that the Appellant was not entitled to a share of the Schedule “B” property in the Schedule “A” building, the parties having been given their respective shares therein.” The Appellant claimed that they had constructed the building under schedule A and produced the required shreds of evidence as well and plead to set aside the Judgment given by the learned trial Court.   In the current trial, the Respondents denied and disputed the claims made by the appellant and claimed that the property wasn’t under Schedule A and was self-acquired. Also, the Appellant had no evidence to claim that he financed the construction.  The court found that the shreds of evidence produced by the Appellant were of 2006 which is after 2 years of construction and didn’t support the case. The court decided that since the floors were divided by the father they are irrevocable as per Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act, 1882, and hence, the Appellant has no right over the 1st floor of the property.  The Hon’ble High Court held,” the undisputed fact is that the property is the self-acquired property of Thakur Giri having been allotted to him vide Exhibit 1. Consequently, vide Exhibit A he distributed the property amongst his sons, and the contents of Exhibit A have been duly proved and admitted by the parties. It is now settled law that the father has the prerogative to distribute his self-acquired property as he desires.” The court referred to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in C.N. Arunachala Mudaliar vs. C.A. Muruganatha Mudaliar and Another[AIR 1953 SC 495] and Govindbhai Chhotabhai Patel and Others vs. Patel Ramanbhai Mathurbhai[(2020) 16 SCC 255] and said,”.. the position of law when the property is self-acquired by the father and he has the right of disposition over it, to which no exception can be taken by his sons/male descendants, as in the instant case.” The Hon’ble High Court of Sikkim in the light of the facts and circumstances found that the judgment of the Learned Trial Court brooks no interference and gave no orders as to cost. The appeal failed and was dismissed by the Court.","['The Hon’ble High Court of Sikkim has held that the Appellant is entitled to a share of the Schedule “A” building.

"The Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in Khalid V. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), CRL.M.C. 1697/2020 held that an accused under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 has the right to be heard against an application for extension of time for completion of investigation accruing out of the proviso to Section 167 of the Cr.P.C as modified by Section 43(d)(2) of UAPA. 
Background-
The accused was charged under UAPA in relation to Delhi Riots, claiming that the ASJ denied his right to oppose the application for extension of time of the investigation against him under UAPA as well wrongfully denied him copies of the application of the Public Prosecutor.

Held-
The bench headed by Hon’ble justice Vibhu Bakru while examining the question as to the right of the accused to be heard and seek copies of application seeking extension of time for completion of investigation under UAPA observed that, “The two questions that are required to be addressed in this petition are: first, whether the accused has a right to be heard to oppose an application seeking extension of time for completion of investigation moved in terms of the proviso to Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.PC) as inserted by virtue of Section 43D(2) of the UAPA; and second, if the answer to the aforesaid question is in the affirmative, whether the accused has a right to a copy of the application seeking extension of time for completion of the investigation and also the report submitted by the Public Prosecutor in terms of the proviso to Section 167 of the Cr.PC as inserted by virtue of Section 43D(2) of the UAPA.”

It was further observed that “It is apparent from the above that a court is proscribed from extending the judicial custody beyond the period specified without a notice to the accused. The purpose of the notice is to afford him an opportunity to oppose the grant of extension beyond the period of ninety days on all legitimate and legal grounds as available to him. The above passage was also referred to by the Division Bench of this Court in Syed Maqbool v. NIA: (2014) 8 HCC (Del)107. In that case, the Division Bench of this Court had, after noting the aforesaid passage, observed that the said decision did not assist the appellants (in that case) in any manner, because notice was served upon the appellants and the learned Designated Court had extended time after arguments were heard.” It was further expounded that “the question whether an accused has a right to be heard to oppose an application seeking extension of his custody and extension of time for completion of the investigation, is answered in the affirmative.”

While examining the issue of supply of copies of the application the Hon’ble Court observed that “The reasons for concealing the report of the Public Prosecutor and the case diaries from the accused during the period of the investigation is to ensure that the investigation is not frustrated. As discussed hereinabove, the manner in which the investigation is progressing and further inquiries that are proposed to take place need not be disclosed to the accused as such disclosure may have the propensity to adversely affect the investigation. It is for this reason that neither the case diaries nor the report submitted by the public prosecutor are required to be furnished to the accused nor are the reasons required to be set out in any detail in the order granting extension of time for completion of the investigation.”

"Insults to religion offered unwittingly or carelessly or without any deliberate or malicious intention to outrage the religious feelings of that class do not come within the purview of sec. 295A of the IPC. This was decided in the case of Sudheer Rikhari v State of Goa &amp; Ors [CRL WRIT PETN No.71 of 2020] by Justice MS Jawalkar and Justice MS Sonak in the Bombay High Court, Goa Bench. The facts of the case date back to 17th December 2019 wherein Dastaan LIVE gave a live performance at Serendipity Arts Festival. During the course of their performance, they used the word “OM” clubbed with the words “Ullu ka pattha”. This according to the complainants amounted to insulting the religious sentiments of the people since the word “OM” is sacred for the Hindus. So, they filed an FIR against the band under sec. 295A read with sec. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. A petition was filed to quash the FIR on the grounds that it was a case of abuse of the criminal process warranting interference as the complaint did not disclose the commission of the said offenses as alleged. The petitioners contended that the undue haste in registering the FIR upon a frivolous complaint suggests that it was driven by political interest with malicious intent to damage the band’s reputation and to curb free speech and creative capital. On the other hand, the respondents opposed the petition stating that the band had a malicious intention to outrage religious feelings. The court referred to the judgment laid down in Manzar Sayeed Khan vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; Anr [(2007) 5 SCC 1 ] wherein the SC referring to the provisions of section 153-A of IPC held that “the prosecution has to prove prima facie the existence of mens rea on the part of the accused. One cannot rely on strongly worded and isolated passages proving the charge nor indeed can one take a sentence here and a sentence there and then connect them by a meticulous process of inferential reasoning.” After closely analyzing the facts of the present case in the background of the ratio laid in the above case, the court observed the that the action of the Respondents was contrary to judicial precedents in matters of arrest or explaining the true scope of Section 295-A of IPC. The FIR was registered hurriedly and possibly without even perusing the complaint or in any case the provisions of section 295-B of the IPC, thereby calling the allegations as vague.",['The Hon’ble High Court of Bombay held that the offence of insulting the religion of a person under section 295 A of the IPC is punishable under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and that it is the responsibility of the State to ensure that the accused are held responsible for the offence. The offence of blasphemy is punishable by imprisonment under the Indian penal code. The accused is held liable for the punishment of the offence under section 293A of IPC. The Police can only be held responsible if the offence is committed under Section 293A.']

"An appellate authority must first hear the case of the petitioner and then pass the order based on the merits of the case. No penalty can be imposed without proper evidence and reasoning.

The petitioner, Ashwani Kumar was a 35 year old constable in the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) under the Ministry of Home Affairs and was posted at a unit of the CISF at Bhilai, District Durg. On 27th January 2007 he was placed under suspension by the assistant commandant for alleged misconduct and after a departmental enquiry, he was penalised with a pay reduction from Rs.3,965 to Rs.3,200 for a period of three years. The petitioner appealed against this penalty to the Deputy Inspector General of the unit at Bhilai, who was the appellate authority. The Deputy Inspector General immediately dismissed the appeal and increased the pay reduction period from three years to five years. The petitioner filed a writ petition before the High Court of Chhattisgarh and contended that the appellate authority violated Rule 52 of the Central Industrial Security Force Rules, 2001 by failing to even consider the appeal and furthermore enhanced the punishment period from three years to five years without any evidence or reason. As a result of this, the petitioner pleaded that the order passed by the Deputy Inspector General of the CISF unit at Bhilai be set aside. The petitioner’s counsel also added that as the petition has been pending for over thirteen years and the petitioner is yet to have a fair hearing, the petition should also consider the facts of the case which the appellate authority failed to do. The respondent’s counsel strongly opposed the petitioner’s prayer and stated that the petitioner has duly been punished for misconduct with five years of pay reduction.",['The appellate authority may be held liable for the imposition of a penalty on the grounds that the penalty is excessive or inadequate or inadequate.

"Petitioner alleged of murder of the informant’s husband denied bail on establishing the grounds that where the deceased suffered several injuries, the petitioner didn’t suffer such injuries. Also, the petitioner didn’t try to find and get the deceased treated and ran away from the place of the accident. The Hon’ble High Court of Patna before Justice Mr. Ahsanuddin Amanullah in the matter Guddu Bhagat and Ors. v. The State of Bihar[Criminal Miscellaneous No.37199 Of 2020].  The facts of the case were that the petitioner was apprehended arrest in connection with the Case, instituted under Sections 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code. It was alleged that the petitioner along with the co-accused had come to the informant’s house and took her husband for purchase but he didn’t return. The next day he was found dead of an accident. It is further alleged that six months ago there was a dispute with the husband and the accused persons and, thus, suspicion has been raised about the involvement of the accused, including the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the allegation is falsified for the reason that if six months before the accident there was a dispute between the accused and the husband of the informant, there could not have been any occasion for the petitioner to have come to the house of the informant/deceased and for him to have accompanied the accused. The witnesses confirmed the accident. There were several injuries mentioned on the report but the petitioner’s report mentioned nothing as such. But it was correct that they met with an accident where the motorbike had fallen 20 feet below. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that because the petitioner had got treatment from a village quack, no records were available, he has not filed any supplementary affidavit. Learned counsel for the informant submitted that it was a pre-planned murder and the petitioner has cleverly given it the color of an accident, which is false. It was submitted that there are multiple injuries on the body of the deceased and the motorcycle does not bear the sign of an accident. It was submitted that the petitioner is said to have regained consciousness and had gone to get treatment, but he did not bother to look for the deceased or arrange for his treatment though he was the one, who had called him and was driving the motorcycle. The Hon’ble High Court Of Patna held,” Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for the parties, the Court finds substance in the submissions of learned APP and learned counsel for the informant. On an overall circumspection of the attending circumstances, the Court finds that the petitioner has not been able to show his bona fide and there is no explanation as to why there was no injury suffered by him, whereas, the deceased has suffered multiple internal injuries on many vital organs and further, that though he was the person, who had called the deceased from the house but he did not take any steps for treatment of the deceased if the story of accident is correct, and soon thereafter the victim had died.” The Court hence denied the pre-arrest bail application.","['The petitioner was arrested for murder in connection with an accident where the petitioner was accused of murder.
